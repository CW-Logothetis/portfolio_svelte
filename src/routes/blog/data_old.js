<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p><span>London,</span><span>&nbsp;July 25</span><span>&nbsp;— Law firms and legal professionals can now review 10,000 pages in under 2 hours and extract&nbsp; key clauses and obligations.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://cognitivplus.com/"><span>Cognitiv+</span></a><span>, the digital disruptor and leading provider of Automated Intelligent Contract Analytics announced it is joining forces with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reynencourt.com/">Reynen Court</a>, making it easier for law firms and in-house legal departments to access high performing and secure legal technology.</span></p>
<p><span>According to a survey conducted by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ey.com/en_uk/law/general-counsel-imperative-barriers-building-blocks"><span>EY</span></a><span>, 68% of general counsel&nbsp;</span><span>say they do not have accurate and up-to-date information about their legal entities, causing uncertainty around the content of the contracts they sign. This is a major risk factor; ignoring data, including information in contracts and other legal documents, comes at a price. Legal technology, such as AI-powered contract analytics, has become a much needed ally when performing accurate and fast document review for critical processes like M&amp;A, due diligence and internal audits. In a market that is overcrowded with a multitude of technology players, what solution should you pick?</span></p>
<p><span>Research by the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.sra.org.uk/globalassets/documents/sra/research/chapter-2---technology-and-innovation-in-legal-services.pdf?version=4a1bfe" data-lf-fd-inspected-xbp1oaerybr8edvj="true"><span>University of Oxford</span></a><span>&nbsp;discovered that 50% of lawyers find a major barrier to the adoption of legal technology to be a lack of staff expertise&nbsp; with its assessment and implementation. While for 70% of survey respondents, client confidentiality and data protection are significant regulatory barriers when adopting, or planning to adopt, legal technology.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Reynen Court ecosystem, which is supported by&nbsp;</span><span>a consortium of leading global law firms and corporate legal departments,</span><span>&nbsp;has been created to<strong>&nbsp;help legal professionals easily</strong></span><span><strong>&nbsp;adopt and manage modern legal technology applications, without jeopardising security or stability</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reynen Court provides an environment&nbsp;</span><span>to securely discover new legal technology&nbsp;</span><span>by&nbsp;</span><span>ensuring access only to trusted and vetted providers. The platform also makes it easy for customers to safely test and deploy new solutions, either to their on-premises cloud or to virtual private clouds hosted by Azure, AWS or Google Cloud.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Cognitiv+ Artificial Intelligence technology successfully exceeded the platform’s strict security requirements, and Reynen Court’s global audience of law firms and legal departments can now deploy it automatically into their own private cloud environments via Reynen Court’s industry-leading platform.</span></p>
<p><span>With Cognitiv+ AI contract analytics,&nbsp;<strong>lawyers can unlock the value of information in their contracts, policies and regulations, mitigate legal risk and achieve faster and better decision-making</strong>. The unique Artificial intelligence capabilities allow for fast review of legal documents, understanding of obligations and extraction of key provisions at scale – accelerating processes like due diligence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By joining the Reynen Court ecosystem, Cognitiv+ pursues its mission of providing law firms and legal departments with a reliable and intuitive solution for automated document review.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It became very time-consuming for law firms and legal departments to find the right document review solution that fits their use case, while data privacy and cybersecurity have become a growing topic of concern” said</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:vasilis.tsolis@cognitivplus.com"><span data-rich-links="{&quot;per_n&quot;:&quot;Vasilis Tsolis&quot;,&quot;per_e&quot;:&quot;vasilis.tsolis@cognitivplus.com&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;person&quot;}">Vasilis Tsolis</span></a><span>, CEO of Cognitiv+. “Reynen Court curation eliminates the bottleneck in adopting new technology while ensuring security standards are respected. Knowing that they get a vetted and secure solution on the Reynen Court Solution Store, customers can focus on leveraging the power of AI-contract analytics to enhance understanding of their legal documents and manage risk. We are extremely proud to be part of the Reynen Court ecosystem”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>According to Sam Moore, Director of Vendor Relations at Reynen Court, “Document review is a critically important aspect of every commercial law firm’s day-to-day activities, and finding the right technology to augment that workflow can be challenging”&nbsp; Cognitiv+ offers some of the most powerful functionality in this product category, and being deployable via Reynen Court means that our platform users can leverage that technology without any client data ever leaving their own IT estate. It’s potentially a game changer for any legal teams who are struggling with manual review, or who are understandably reluctant to upload huge repositories of sensitive documents to a third-party SaaS environment. We’re delighted to offer Cognitiv+ to our platform users as a fully deployable application”.</span></p>

And building your own AI system is something many organizations consider: however, it is rarely a viable choice. The challenges are quite a few (see the <a href="https://www.cognitivplus.com/boost-your-product-with-artificial-intelligence-with-the-cognitiv-api-part-one/">Part One</a> of our article), yet being able to assess how to incorporate AI into your solution or organization and the best way to achieve that is critical.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Build or to partner, this is the question</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it often happens, given the increasing demand for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> RPA and automated processing capabilities,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> businesses are facing themselves with the classic strategic dilemma in AI: <strong>Build or Partner</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision rests largely on your use case and urgency to fill the gap. Not necessarily on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> owning the IP</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – as many would think.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s true that developing AI in-house allows you to have full control on the IP- yet, it ignores all the sunk costs related to the initial stages of development and deployment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We heard the buzz: democratization of AI is here, ready for us to grasp. This is based on&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A. Proliferation of AI engines by big-tech (Google, Amazon, Microsoft…)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B. Continuous promotion of new features for said engines</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations are increasingly <strong>becoming convinced that they can develop their own AI</strong> (and perhaps do it quickly). However, these engines are merely AI infrastructure: much like WordPress, Drupal are for building web applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it’s true, developing ML models has become relatively easy – something a motivated techie can teach themselves online. Which means more and more enterprises are able to use machine learning to automate, predict, plan, and personalize their products and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But does it mean you <strong>should</strong> build your own ML technology?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While actually building models has gotten easier, translating them from science projects into <strong>reliable, scalable</strong> software that brings businesses value is still hard.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What organizations really are missing is that these tools are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">generic</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Developing and advancing them to meet niche industry or scenario needs, requires maturity, domain expertise and repeatability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>General AI</strong> means that the models provided are not optimized for specific needs – be it <strong>legal or financial</strong>. This in turn means that these models need to be trained to understand domain specific content.&nbsp; As we saw before, this is the hard part: a time consuming process that starts from data collection and processing and proceeds to model training, testing and validating. Sure AutoML is great and easy to tackle, but let’s face the truth: building fully functional models <strong>takes months</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://stagingweb.cognitivplus.com/contact" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Contact us to know more about the Cognitiv+ API</strong></a></h6>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="//www.cognitivplus.com">Cognitiv+</a> we are fully aware of the pain points of building your own AI application.&nbsp;</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know it because we have been developing AI technology for legal document review since 2015, not only constantly refining and enhancing its capabilities but also making sure that a solid MLOps structure was in place to allow smoothless scalability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our AI document review technology is one of the <strong>most advanced on the market</strong> and features:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proprietary machine learning model recognising over <strong>10,000 clause types</strong> clustered into 256 clause families</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>9 pre-built turnkey templates</strong> including credit agreements, service agreements, lease agreements and regulations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distinct ability to understand and <strong>extract Obligations</strong> and allow users to rank them on the basis of their severity, for deeper risk analysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of its kind <strong>no-code AutoML interface</strong> for&nbsp; professionals to build custom models for their own documents and use in their projects.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While we offer these features on a SaaS platform, we realized how pivotal it would be for partner applications to be able to leverage our capabilities through an <strong>API</strong>. And that’s what we have worked on in the past few months.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turn on your AI, with Cognitiv+ API: endless data extraction power at scale.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have built a product for legal use and wish to leverage the cutting edge capabilities of our AI document review technology, you can integrate through our API to extend the potential of your platform, fully tapping into the power of legal AI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>Cognitiv+ API</strong> allows you to build on the back of a solid infrastructure, delivering new value to your clients and ultimately capturing new revenue streams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some examples of what you can achieve through Cognitiv+ API</span></p>
<p><strong>Enhance the granularity and quality of your database</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cognitiv+ technology has been developed to extract data from legal documents with an extremely high accuracy and granularity. Our Vision AI technology can process scanned and handwritten documents and automatically extract data points. By integrating your DMS with Cognitiv+ technology, you can improve the quality, quantity and granularity of your data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Boost contract comparison</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redlining and blacklining is essential to contract drafting and contract review.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning technology, partners can AI-power their contract comparison system. Our technology can automatically highlight differences between contracts, pinpointing any changes and anomalies and summarize them in a redlined document – boosting the capabilities of your software.</span></p>
<p><strong>Automate contract classification</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clustering your contracts into a taxonomy is key for proper management of your library of contracts – but also for internal business processes like contract triaging and contract queueing. Classification can be automated through our AI technology that can recognise and cluster clauses, clause families and documents with no risk to jeopardize accuracy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cognitiv+ API Features</span></h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of the pandemic, lockdown measures have been adopted by the UK and other countries across the globe at varying degrees and often included closing down large swaths of commercial properties.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the asset management firm </span><a href="https://research-center.amundi.com/page/Article/Insights-Paper/2020/06/Covid-19-short-term-pain-long-term-opportunities-for-European-commercial-real-estate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amundi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, retail was one of the segments hit most harshly by the pandemic due to the lockdown measures. Residential real estate on the other hand was also affected by the provisions of the UK Coronavirus Act 2020, which suspended a landlord’s right to take forfeiture action in case of missed payments.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a contract management perspective this involved the necessity to carefully evaluate the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal status</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quo:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring <strong>compliance</strong> with current law provisions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Reviewing and analysing</strong> the leasehold agreements clauses and obligations</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, if necessary, <strong>renegotiating</strong> the leases terms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, often under time pressure.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Book a free demo of our document review technology to speed up the negotiation process of lease agreements</h4>
<strong>Contract clauses that UK landlords need to look at typically include:</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rent concessions</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;— </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://on24static.akamaized.net/event/26/37/37/2/rt/1/documents/resourceList1602021747617/mostnegotiatedtermsreport20201602021746560.pdf" data-lf-fd-inspected-xbp1oaerybr8edvj="true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by World Commerce &amp; Contracting Association and iCertis, price was the second most negotiated contract term in 2020. Not dissimilarly, in real estate, the rent value has been on the forefront of renegotiation. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although tenants can request for a rent reduction or a renegotiation of the terms, English and Scots law does not require that landlords must accept the proposal in a commercial lease scenario. However, regarding commercial contracts, this is considered an evolving case law and landlords may experience reputational or commercial pressure to renegotiate lease terms toward a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> combination of a rent holiday, rent reduction and/or extended time to pay</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Insurance</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;—It’s not uncommon for tenants to pay a premium to landlords that cover insured risks. These insured risks will differ depending on the lease, so it is crucial for the tenant and landlord to review the agreement to verify if the pandemic does fall within the category of insured risks in the lease. In this case,&nbsp; the tenant may qualify for rent suspension by following a strict procedure as outlined by the lease agreement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Keep open clause</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> —Keep open clauses&nbsp; oblige retail and other tenants to remain open for trading, often for avoiding the impact that closing a shop could have on the centre and surrounding commerce. Due to potential conflicts between the provisions of the lease and the government’s official guidelines and rules, these clauses incite disputes between involved parties and need to be carefully reviewed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Health and safety</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;— Under&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hse.gov.uk/leadership/legislation.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health and safety law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, tenants must consider threats to the health and safety of employees, while landlords have responsibilities to the extent they are in control of the premises. Health and safety law mandates that organisations must assess risks to employees, customers, partners, and others affected by their activities; arrange for the effective planning, organisation, control, monitoring, and review of preventive and protective measures; have a written health and safety policy if they employ five or more people; and consult employees about their risks at work and current preventive and protective measures. This would require a reassessment of internal policies&nbsp; and lease agreements to determine who is to bear the cost and the burden of health and safety compliance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Withholding of rent</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the 2020 Health Protection Regulations, specified leisure and retail premises are required to be closed to members of the public. Landlords can also decide it’s safer and cost effective for the building to be closed, even if there is no legal requirement. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s debated whether tenants have the right to withhold payment of the rent in these cases, rather than resort to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">recovering damages for breach of covenant as a separate action. In these cases, the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wording of the agreements need to be checked.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>The advantages of AI for reviewing contract terms</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all the cases mentioned above, being able to review the lease agreement portfolio at scale proves critical. However, manual&nbsp; review process is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tedious, costly and time consuming. A lease agreement can take multiple hours to review and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID added urgency to the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document review can be tackled using artificial intelligence-powered technology like <a href="https://cognitivplus.com/what-artificial-intelligence-can-do-for-real-estate-lawyers/"><strong>Cognitiv+</strong></a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to review a large number of agreements in minutes, quickly identify and extract the relevant terms and feed them into your database management system is critical. </span><a href="https://cognitivplus.com/what-is-lease-abstraction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cognitiv+</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been designed to enhance and automate the review of <a href="https://cognitivplus.com/what-is-lease-abstraction/"><strong>lease agreements at scale</strong></a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are getting more familiar by the day with Artificial intelligence and Natural language Processing applications. eCommerce Recommendation systems, Vision-based algorithms or AI-powered chatbots that can handle multiple queries at once: are all based on AI and are all examples of General AI.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<!--more-->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all truth, while the idea of Artificial intelligence invariably evokes images of intelligent robots, smart-assistants or even self-driving cars, these applications just scrape the surface of what where AI can be useful for.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A much less talked to -and one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the areas where AI has been proving the most powerful- is at the intersection of <strong>Financial procurement, Legal Audit and Business Operations.</strong> Here, domain-specific AI unfolds its true potential.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automating Knowledge and Insight generation</span></h3> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pace of change, and evolution of technology is forcing organization’s to engage in increased and novel business activity to maintain competitive edge. With increased business activity comes diversified contract activity — proposals to be formed, agreements to be negotiated and terms to be reviewed. Much of the work is supported by departmental stakeholders, internal analysts or with the help of external legal advisors or law firm partners.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stripped to the barebones, this sort of operational work invariably involves 3 phases:&nbsp;</span></p> 
<ol> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Sourcing, identifying and analysing</strong> relevant information. For instance, during due diligence, legal and audit teams need to select the parts of the business that need to be audited, sourcing the contracts and financial documents that needed to be looked at;</span></li> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Organizing information into understandable schemas</strong>: once collected, information needs to be sorted and much time is spent manually fitting data into existing schemas or systems. In the insurance industry for instance, customers fill claims in a variety of formats both on paper, online. Data needs to be organized in a standardised way so it’s easier to read, digest, store into DB for later analysis.&nbsp;</span></li> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Communicating</strong> the information to the relevant department and coordinating the work. Once the material has been processed and the information extracted, it needs to be sent to the relevant department for evaluation.&nbsp;</span></li> 
</ol> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this date, much of the focus has been on enabling more of 3: organizational efficiency has been taking the center stage. But the greatest challenges – yet most anticipated value – is expected to come from how businesses do 1) and 2).&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses need to be handling documents and paperwork – only at greater volumes; parsing through the text and selecting important information – only faster, and structuring into machine-enabled, digital formats for further processing – only more automatically, and effectively.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And all of this whilst upkeeping or increasing accuracy and being able to compete at a lower cost.</span></p> 
<blockquote> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the areas where AI has been proving the most powerful- is at the intersection of <strong>Financial procurement, Legal Audit and Business Operations.</strong></span></p> 
</blockquote> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>In these areas, AI proves to be a real game changer</strong>, offering endless capabilities to improve team and business operations when it comes to speed, accuracy and responsiveness, unlocking new efficiencies and enabling new ways of working.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of -widely used- Document Management, Enterprise Content Management, Collaborative file storage systems that are the backbone of every organization. These systems are the infrastructure for knowledge management. Starting with files and documents, and enhancing them with AI is becoming a focus for many providers as they try to serve more needs for their client base. Actually, leveraging NLP capabilities could provide multi-directional ways of clustering and sorting data which would enable novel information flows within the knowledge management strategy.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, Contract Lifecycle Management technology provides lawyers with a single platform for negotiating, drafting and signing contracts – leading to substantial efficiency and cost savings. Integrating those capabilities with AI – for instance for contract review, redlining or clustering is a much needed feature and a path that some companies are starting to explore.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly&nbsp; ERPs, Analytics and Big Data platforms, and Workflow/Automation platforms are all prone to leverage the potential of AI.&nbsp;</span> </p> 
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The harsh truth about AI&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how easy is it for companies to <strong>build their own AI platform</strong> or add new natural language processing capabilities to a product? The short answer is: <strong>it’s hard.</strong></span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truth is, many AI projects fail. A </span><a href="https://www.capgemini.com/consulting/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2017/07/big_data_pov_03-02-15.pdf" data-lf-fd-inspected-xbp1oaerybr8edvj="true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Capgemini found that only 27% of enterprise data projects are successful, while Gartner predicted that </span><b>85 percent of AI projects won’t deliver</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although open resources are widely available, building steady, scalable Artificial Intelligence solutions is by no means easy.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lack of data scientists is one of the reasons: the competition for qualified data talent is especially fierce – </span><a href="https://quanthub.com/data-scientist-shortage-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">QuantHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rated “data science/analytics” as the second most difficult skill set to find (after “cybersecurity”).</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, the research and development phase is costly, long and requires multiple iterations. The annotation and training process, essential to any NLP application, is painstakingly t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ime-consuming.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In a survey by data labelling company Alexion, 72% of the data scientists interviewed reported that Production-Level Model confidence will require more than 100,000 labeled data items.&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to another survey by </span><a href="https://dotscience.com/assets/downloads/Dotscience_Survey-Report-2019.pdf" data-lf-fd-inspected-xbp1oaerybr8edvj="true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DotScience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 65% of companies said it’s taking them from 7 to 18 months to move their ML models from idea to production.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, even when you get it right, scaling up proves to be difficult and</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the transition from software engineering into production environments that scale is rarely seamless. Having steady MLOps in place is critical and extremely difficult to achieve: a ML model requires constant monitoring and fine-tuning to make sure it performs optimally and stays updated. MLOps involves creating a machine learning pipeline to automate the retraining of existing models, optimizing the process reaching full efficiency.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This again requires time, costs and a fully dedicated team.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you commit to developing your own AI, you need to take into account a few factors: the time for building <strong>reliable, scalable AI</strong>; the cost for <strong>platforms and human resources</strong>; the opportunity cost of not being able to focus on your core business. Is it really worth it?&nbsp;</span></p>

<!--more-->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a law firm, many of the tasks carried out by lawyers are not strictly legal. Lawyers have to deal with financial, administrative, IT and vendor management tasks, while ensuring that the law firm operations keep on running smoothly. Not easy and extremely time consuming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;In fact, there is a whole system that manages these processes as efficiently as possible, Legal Operations. Quite a few processes fall under the umbrella of legal operations, but the most common include improving workflow, standardizing tasks, extracting critical information from documents and optimizing resources.</span></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing the clerical and administrative work from the equation improves performance by positioning law professionals to focus primarily on the legal end. In addition to increasing overall productivity, legal operations reduces the reliance on external forms of legal counsel.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>6 Key Responsibilities of legal operations professionals</b></h3> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal operations professionals provide a variety of services, such as:</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ol> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Strategise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Develop actionable strategies and initiatives that bolster process workflows to increase productivity.</span></li> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Define/track metrics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Identify, incorporate, and track metrics to ensure that current or future processes provide clearly defined and measurable improvements.</span></li> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Working cross-functionally</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Add value to a team by incorporating various expertise and skill sets to meet a common goal.</span></li> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Optimisation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Effectively leverage the firm’s internal and external resources to improve performance and increase VFM (value for money).</span></li> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Tech-oriented solutions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Integrate technology, such as AI, into processes to maximize productivity and decrease labour costs.</span></li> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Spend management</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Manage outside legal counsel spend by maintaining visibility of spend, pursue opportunities to reduce cost, and budgeting.</span></li> 
</ol> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3><b>Improving legal operations with artificial intelligence</b></h3> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence enables a whole suite of solutions to streamline legal operations by cutting down on time, cost, labour, and stress.</span></p> 
<p><b>Time and cost</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The automation of repetitive tasks with machine learning technology can drastically reduce the time required to identify and analyze relevant contract provisions. Unlike conventional labour, artificial intelligence maintains a consistent pace and reviews each line of text with the same degree of focus and effectiveness from start to finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://cognitivplus.com">Cognitiv+</a>’s highly accurate machine learning technology can identify and analyze relevant contract provisions, resulting in customer-reported time savings of 30–70%.</span></p> 
<p><b>Risk mitigation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risks come in all shapes and sizes but share one key characteristic: they are costly. Artificial intelligence can offer a <a href="https://cognitivplus.com/artificial-intelligence-risk-mitigator/">360-degree approach to risk mitigation</a> and can maintain an efficiency that is out of reach for conventional contract analysis. Artificial intelligence also addresses these three common problems:</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<ol> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Human error</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Large workloads can make even the most seasoned associate slip up and make a mistake. For example, with M&amp;A due diligence projects, associates are often tasked to review a sea of contracts to catch potential criticalities. These requests are often paired with a tight deadline and require an intense level of focus that inevitably diminishes due to tedium.</span></li> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Availability bias</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Unfortunately, this is a common problem plaguing the due diligence process that stems from only reviewing about 10</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">20% of a contract pool. More often than not, critical information is overlooked or outright missed until after the M&amp;A process. Artificial intelligence remedies this by affording associates the means to analyse an entire contract pool.&nbsp;</span></li> 
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Identifying new info</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Artificial intelligence can review documents with a larger degree of efficiency to catch inconsistent elements. Document review technology can even point out potential instances of fraud by identifying changes in the patterns of invoices over a select timeframe or an uncommonly invoiced item.</span></li> 
</ol> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><b>Establish a data-driven approach</b></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document review powered by Artificial intelligence excels in extracting crucial information from legal documents. Some examples of extractable data include prices, fees as well as termination dates. Further, this data can be used to help anticipate the collection of late fees or the renewal/termination of contracts.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cognitivplus.com/">Cognitiv+</a> technology allows for extraction of data at scale, while you can use your domain-specific parameters and develop <a href="https://resources.cognitivplus.com/graybox-whitepaper">custom Machine Learning (ML) models</a> for legal insight extraction without the need of data-scientists</span></p> 
<p><b>Workflow optimization</b></p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial intelligence is most effective when used as an integrated solution.&nbsp;The right application programming interface offers the best of both worlds by allowing you to enhance preexisting systems or create a new one with machine learning technology as the foundation. Cognitiv+ API allows for fast integration with existing DMS systems and other technology.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <div class="blog-post_text">
        <span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" class="hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_rich_text" style="" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artificial Intelligence has been on the legal scene for a few years now – but it’s still uncommon to find legal technology solutions focused solely on<strong> property law</strong>. </span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are AI-powered solutions that range from legal research to contract management but they haven’t been designed to cater to the needs of a particular legal niche. This is critical, because different legal sectors have their own set of challenges and requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, Proptech is a growing sector, with innovative AI-powered technology designed for&nbsp; improving the management and development of real estate. But again, only few PropTech solutions take lawyers into account. More often, PropTech focuses on maintenance and management of premises – though a fusion of IoT and AI capabilities. <strong>Little attention has been given to the legal “side” of every property business</strong>: negotiation, due diligence, deal management, monitoring of the contracts portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neglected both by PropTech and LegalTech, real estate lawyers needed our support. We could not remain indifferent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in all truth, there are a number of ways real estate lawyers can benefit from the untapped potential of Artificial Intelligence. To name a few: automating the document review process, extracting relevant information, and ensuring compliance with existing regulations by speeding up their review, identifying relevant obligations and legal amendments, flagging discrepancies with existing corporate policies: all activities that lawyers have to carry out, in high volumes, repeatedly. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Document review</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agreements are the bread and butter of real estate lawyers and attentive document review, during a due diligence process, negotiation or sales process is both time consuming and error prone. Artificial Intelligence-powered document review allows for a faster, more-attentive analysis of the document and summarises the results in an easily digestible format.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://cognitivplus.com/"><strong>Cognitiv+</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; intelligent document review technology is trained to read contracts and recognise major data insights from main contract models. Our technology can also extract obligations and rank them on the basis of their severity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Lease Abstraction</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <a href="https://cognitivplus.com/what-is-lease-abstraction/">lease abstract</a> is a document that real estate lawyers know pretty well: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an easily navigable document which includes the most relevant legal and financial information included in a lease agreement: basically a summary of the lease, with the most important data outlined for easy and quick review.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophisticated artificial intelligence technology like Cognitiv+ makes it possible to create accurate lease abstracts automatically and at scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI l</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ease abstraction technology is trained to recognise major data insights within lease agreements such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Names of the tenant(s) and landlord</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address and square footage of the space</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rent&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ground rent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service charges</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the tenant has right of first refusal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Termination Clause</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rent indexation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate taxes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">And many other Covid-19 relevant clauses</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Regulatory Compliance</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the relevant regulations that are going to impact on the real estate sector – – is essential.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means being able to navigate complex regulatory instruments looking for the provisions that apply to your case: for instance the <a href="https://cognitivplus.com/summarizing-uk-coronavirus-act-2020-with-cognitiv/">Coronavirus Act 2020</a> contains a large number of sections of which only a handful impact, albeit strongly, the real estate sector.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cognitiv+ Artificial Intelligence technology has been trained to review and identify relevant obligations from existing regulations.&nbsp; The neural translation system makes it possible to translate from 50 other languages into English, allowing you to process and understand foreign legislation.</span></p>
<h3>Personalisation</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to analyse particular documents and extract only the clauses and provisions that matter for your business is equally important. With our machine learning <a href="https://cognitivplus.com/graybox/">annotator</a>, real estate lawyers are able to easily train the software to identify and extract only the data they need.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the potential Uses of Cognitiv+ in real estate</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://cognitivplus.com/real-estate-due-diligence-in-covid-19-times/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due diligence</span></a></p>

Distilled into its most basic form, repapering is defined as a large remediation of documentation that involves risk assessing, amending, and migrating contracts — often employed by financial service institutions and insurance companies. Further, this process aids in contingency planning or relocation. For companies operating on the global stage, repapering is an inescapable reality that businesses must adapt to.</span></p> 
<!--more-->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent example that highlights the necessity of an effective repapering platform involves <a href="https://cognitivplus.com/the-impact-of-brexit-on-commercial-contracts/">Brexit</a>, in which a no-deal Brexit meant that (without the correct paperwork) UK companies could no longer be allowed to provides goods and services to EU27. Another example is <a href="https://cognitivplus.com/there-is-life-after-libor/">LIBOR, the benchmark set to expire in 2021</a>, which is embedded into almost all financial contracts with a variable interest rate component.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>The obstacles of repapering</h3> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the immense undertaking that repaper characteristically entails, conducting this process manually is extremely labour, resource and time-intensive. One of the most difficult aspects of this is the coordination and cooperation of finance, legal, and operations teams who are tasked to discover and assess relevant contracts and clauses. Couple this with a high likelihood for human error, and manual repapering is less than ideal.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another underappreciated issue brought about by manual repapering is that the process is growing increasingly complex. In turn, the human element of repapering scales poorly in comparison to increasing demands and a sometimes seemingly endless workload. Although some legal teams can attempt to manually manage repapering through sampling, it adds needless and expensive risk that can be mitigated by simply using a repapering platform.</span></p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<h3>How Cognitiv+ platform can help with repapering – 5 key features</h3> 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cognitivplus.com/review-platform/">Cognitiv+</a> &nbsp;provides a platform that takes the pain away from the challenges of repapering: reviewing the dataset of agreements, identifying the ones that require remediation, carrying out a throughout risk assessment, and determining the relevant clauses or sections that need to be amended.
