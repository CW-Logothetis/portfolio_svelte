        <p class="intro--para">As I’m a bit of a history nut, I’ve visited quite a few of the archaeological sites in Greece and the southern Balkans. So when I was thinking of a personal project to test my Figma and responsive design skills, I thought this would be a good fit. Especially as I have my own photographs to use.</p>            
        <p class="intro--para">There are over a hundred Greek and then Roman theatres, so I just selected five from the Greek period, but nipped over the border into modern day Albania to show two that are relatively unknown.</p>            
        <p class="intro--para">Note: as the aim here was to practice web design, the theatre pages use placeholder or duplicated text.</p>
