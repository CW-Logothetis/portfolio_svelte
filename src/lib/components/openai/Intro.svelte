        <p class="intro--para">Since I was first learning to code, I wanted a quick reference for array methods.</p>
        <p class="intro--para">MDN docs were far too advanced for a beginner. And there are a thousand blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets online doing some methods. But I couldn't remember which methods were even available.</p>
        <p class="intro--para">So I had the idea to summarise MDN docs for each method, then allow me to select methods for comparison.</p>
        <p class="intro--para">I never got around to it - too much content to write. But now OpenAI can do the content for me.</p>
