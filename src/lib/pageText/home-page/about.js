    "I’m a front-end developer, specialising in SvelteKit and React, modern JavaScript, accessibility and responsive CSS.",
    "JavaScript aside, I enjoy keeping up-to-date with new additions to CSS, working with UX/UI teams and designing myself with Figma. I've worked in Agile teams, with sprints, point estimation and backlog groomings, collaborating in GitHub and Jira.",
    "And once upon a time, I spent seven years as a lawyer in London. But my love for building stuff meant that the law wasn’t for me. So I first built and ran my own business, and it was there that I fell in love with web design and UX/UI, then code."
