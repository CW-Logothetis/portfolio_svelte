        <p>Bidding is standard in many industries, from construction to IT to marketing. It can be a great way to win new business and grow your company. However, bidding can also be a time-consuming, cumbersome task.</p>

        <p>Here are some of the risks and challenges of bidding:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk of losing money.</strong> If you bid too low, you could lose money on the project. This is especially true if you are unfamiliar with the project's scope or underestimate the costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk of not winning the bid.</strong> Even if you bid the right price, there is no guarantee that you will win the bid. There may be other bidders who are more qualified or experienced than you.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk of delays and problems.</strong> Bidding can be lengthy, and delays or issues are always risky. This can lead to missed deadlines and financial losses.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk of overcommitting.</strong> When you bid on a project, you commit to completing the work. If you overcommit, you may not be able to deliver on your promises, which could damage your reputation.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk of burnout.</strong> Bidding can be a very time-consuming and stressful process. If you are not careful, you can quickly burn out.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Despite the risks, bidding can be a rewarding experience if you do it right. Here are some tips for minimising the risks and challenges of bidding:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Do your research.</strong> Before bidding on a project, ensure you understand the scope of work, budget, and timeline. Researching the competition to understand their strengths and weaknesses would be best.</li>
        <li><strong>Set realistic expectations.</strong> Don't bid too low; don't expect to win every bid. Be realistic about your chances of winning and set your expectations accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Build relationships.</strong> Networking with other professionals in your industry can help you get more bids and win more projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a bidding platform.</strong> Several bidding platforms are available that can help you streamline the bidding process. These platforms can help you manage bids, track progress, and communicate with potential clients.</li>
        <li><strong>Get help from a professional.</strong> If you are uncomfortable bidding alone, you can hire a professional bidding consultant to help you. A consultant can help you with your research, writing, and negotiation skills.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By following these tips, you can minimise the risks and challenges of bidding and increase your chances of winning new business.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to the tips above, here are some other things to keep in mind when bidding:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Be clear and concise in your bid. The evaluators should be able to easily understand what you are offering and why you are the best choice for the job.</li>
        <li>Proofread your bid carefully before submitting it. Typos and grammatical errors will make you look unprofessional and could cost you the offer.</li>
        <li>Be prepared to answer questions. The evaluators may have questions about your bid, so be ready to answer them clearly and concisely.</li>
        <li>Follow up after submitting your bid. Send a thank-you note to the evaluators and reiterate your interest in the project.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By following these tips, you can increase your chances of winning the next bid you submit.</p>

        <p>Bidders, listen up! To win more bids, you must submit your requests on time. This may seem like a no-brainer, but it's a common mistake that can cost you the job.</p>

        <p>Here are a few tips to help you bid on time:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Start early.</strong> Don't wait until the last minute to start working on your bid. Give yourself ample time to research the project, gather your information, and write your proposal.</li>
        <li><strong>Set a deadline for yourself.</strong> Once you know when the bid is due, set a deadline for yourself to have it finished. This will help you stay on track and avoid rushing at the last minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Delegate tasks.</strong> If you have a team, delegate tasks to different people so everyone can work on the bid simultaneously. This will help you get the offer done faster.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a project management tool.</strong> A project management tool can help you keep track of all the tasks involved in the bid process. This can be especially helpful if you have a lot of moving parts.</li>
        <li><strong>Proofread your bid carefully.</strong> Before you submit your request, proofread it carefully for any errors. A single typo could cost you the job.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>These tips will help you bid on time and increase your chances of winning the job.</p>
        
        <p>Here are some additional tips that you can follow to bid on time:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Get organised.</strong> Create a folder or project management system to keep your bid documents and information in one place. This will make it easy to find what you need when you need it.</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate with the client.</strong> If you have any questions about the bid, don't hesitate to ask the client. The sooner you get clarification, the sooner you can start working on your proposal.</li>
        <li><strong>Be flexible.</strong> Things don't always go according to plan, so be prepared to adjust your timeline as needed. If you encounter unexpected delays, communicate with the client and let them know what's going on.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't give up.</strong> If you miss the deadline for one bid, don't give up. Learn from your mistakes and try again next time.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Bidding on time is essential for winning more contracts. By following these tips, you can increase your chances of submitting your bids on time and winning the jobs you want.</p>
        
        <p>Here are some common mistakes to avoid when bidding on time:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Waiting until the last minute to start working on your bid.</li>
        <li>Not setting a deadline for yourself.</li>
        <li>Not delegating tasks.</li>
        <li>Not using a project management tool.</li>
        <li>Not proofreading your bid carefully.</li>

        <p>Contracts are a necessary part of doing business. They can be used to protect your interests, define the terms of an agreement, and resolve disputes. However, contracts can also be complex and challenging to understand, especially for non-legal professionals.</p>

        <p>If you're not a lawyer, don't worry. You can do a few things to read contracts effectively and protect yourself:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Know the basics of contract law.</strong> Before you start reading a contract, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of contract law. This will help you understand the terms and conditions of the agreement and identify any potential problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Take your time.</strong> Don't try to read a contract in one sitting. Take your time and read it carefully, line by line. If you don't understand something, ask a lawyer for help.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight the essential terms.</strong> As you read the contract, highlight the essential terms, such as the price, the delivery date, and the payment terms. This will help you quickly find the information you need later.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask questions.</strong> If you have any questions about the contract, don't hesitate to ask the other party or a lawyer. It's better to ask questions now than to have problems later.</li>
        <li><strong>Negotiate the terms.</strong> Not all contracts are created equal. You can negotiate if you're unhappy with the contract terms. This is especially important if you're the weaker party to the agreement.</li>
        <li><strong>Get everything in writing.</strong> Once you agree to the contract terms, ensure everything is in writing. This will help avoid disputes down the road.</li>
        <li><strong>Review the contract regularly.</strong> Once the contract is signed, it's essential to review it regularly to ensure it meets your needs. If anything changes, be sure to update the agreement accordingly.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>By following these tips, you can read contracts effectively and protect yourself. Remember, contracts are legal documents that can significantly impact your business. It's essential to take the time to understand them before you sign them.</p>
        
        <p>Here are some additional tips for reading contracts as a non-legal professional:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Use a dictionary or legal terminology guide to look up any words or phrases you don't understand.</li>
        <li>Don't be afraid to ask for help from a lawyer or other experienced professional.</li>
        <li>Be aware of the potential risks involved in the contract and take steps to mitigate those risks.</li>
        <li>Don't sign a contract you don't fully understand or are uncomfortable with.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Following these tips can protect yourself and your business when reading and signing contracts.</p>

        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing how we live and work. It is used in various applications, from facial recognition to self-driving cars. AI is also being used to collect and analyse personal data on a massive scale.</p>

        <p>This raises privacy concerns. AI has the potential to collect and store more personal data than ever before, and it can use this data to make predictions about our behaviour. This could lead to discrimination, identity theft, and other privacy violations.</p>
        
        <p>As a result, privacy laws are likely to change in response to AI. Here are some of the ways that AI is expected to change privacy laws:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>New laws will be passed to regulate AI.</strong> Governments around the world are already considering new rules to regulate AI. These laws will likely focus on data collection, use, and privacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Existing laws will be interpreted differently.</strong> As AI becomes more sophisticated, existing privacy laws may need to be interpreted differently. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires companies to obtain consent before collecting and using personal data. However, it is unclear how this requirement will apply to AI-powered applications that collect and use data without human intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>Companies will need to take new steps to protect privacy.</strong> AI-powered companies will need to take further steps to protect privacy. This could include using encryption, anonymising data, and giving users more control over their data.</li>
        <li><strong>Individuals will need to be more aware of their privacy risks.</strong> Individuals will need to be more aware of their privacy risks in the age of AI. This means being careful about what data they share online and how they use AI-powered applications.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The changes to privacy laws that AI brings about will be complex and challenging. However, addressing these challenges to protect privacy in the digital age is essential.</p>
        
        <p>Here are some specific examples of how AI is already changing privacy laws:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has recently brought cases against companies that use AI to collect and use personal data without users' consent.</li>
        <li>In the European Union, the GDPR has been interpreted to require companies to give users more control over their data, even when AI-powered applications use that data.</li>
        <li>In China, the government has passed new laws that restrict the use of AI for facial recognition and other applications.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>These are just a few examples of AI changing privacy laws. As AI becomes more sophisticated, we will likely see even more changes to privacy laws.</p>
        
        <h2>What can we do to protect our privacy in the age of AI?</h2>
        
        <p>There are a few things that we can do to protect our privacy in the age of AI:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Be careful about what data we share online.</li>
        <li>Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication.</li>
        <li>Be aware of the privacy policies of the companies we do business with.</li>
        <li>Use privacy-focused browsers and apps.</li>
        <li>Support organisations that are working to protect privacy.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>By taking these steps, we can help to protect our privacy in the digital age.</p>

        <p>In today's digital age, data is a valuable asset. It can create new products and services, improve business operations, and make better decisions. However, data is also vulnerable to theft, misuse, and loss.</p>

        <p>One way to protect data is to use the correct contractual terms. By carefully drafting contracts, businesses can limit their data risks and ensure their data is handled properly.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Contractual Terms for Protecting Data</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Data security requirements:</strong> The contract should specify the security measures the other party must take to protect the data. This could include encryption, access controls, and disaster recovery plans.</li>
        <li><strong>Data breach notification:</strong> The contract should require the other party to notify the business immediately if there is a data breach. This will give the business time to take steps to mitigate the damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Data localisation:</strong> The contract should specify where the data will be stored. This can help to protect the data from being accessed by unauthorised parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Data retention:</strong> The contract should specify how long the other party will retain the data. This will help ensure that the data is not kept longer than necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Data deletion:</strong> The contract should specify how the other party will delete the data when it is no longer needed. This will help to prevent the data from being misused or lost.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Additional Considerations</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>The data type being transferred:</strong> Some classes are more sensitive than others, so the contractual terms should be tailored accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>The purpose of the data transfer:</strong> The purpose for which the data is being transferred will also affect the contractual terms.</li>
        <li><strong>The relationship between the parties:</strong> The relationship between the parties to the contract will also affect the terms. For example, a contract between a business and its customer will differ from a contract between a company and its supplier.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Get legal advice:</strong> It is essential to get legal advice when drafting contracts to protect data. A lawyer can help ensure the contracts are appropriately prepared and meet the business's needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Use standard forms:</strong> Businesses can use several legal forms to protect their data. These forms can be a good starting point but should be tailored to the business's needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Be proactive:</strong> Businesses should not wait for a data breach to occur before taking steps to protect their data. By being proactive, businesses can reduce the risk of a data breach and the damage that it can cause.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Lakes and Contract Discovery</h2>
        
        <p>Data lakes are a centralised repository for all an organisation's data, regardless of source or format. This makes it possible to store and analyse data from various sources, including contracts.</p>
        
        <p>Contract discovery is finding and extracting contracts from a data lake. This can be challenging, as contracts can be unstructured and heterogeneous. However, several tools and techniques can be used to automate contract discovery.</p>
        
        <h2>Why is contract discovery important?</h2>
        
        <p>There are several reasons why contract discovery is essential. First, it can help organisations to comply with regulations. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires organisations to record all personal data they process. Contract discovery can help organisations to find and identify contracts that contain personal data.</p>
        
        <p>Second, contract discovery can help organisations to manage their risks. For example, if an organisation is involved in a dispute, contract discovery can help the organisation find the relevant contracts that may be needed to resolve the dispute.</p>
        
        <p>Third, contract discovery can help organisations to improve their decision-making. For example, by analysing contracts, organisations can gain insights into their business partners and their relationships with those partners. This information can be used to make better pricing, marketing, and strategic partnership decisions.</p>
        
        <h2>How can data lakes be used for contract discovery?</h2>
        
        <p>Data lakes can be used for contract discovery in several ways. One way is to use natural language processing (NLP) to extract keywords and phrases from contracts. These keywords and phrases can then be used to search for agreements relevant to a particular topic.</p>

        <p>Another way to use data lakes for contract discovery is to use machine learning (ML). ML algorithms can be trained to identify patterns in contracts. These patterns can then be used to classify contracts into different categories automatically.</p>

        <p>Finally, data lakes can create a knowledge graph of contracts. A knowledge graph is a network of entities and relationships. In contract discovery, a knowledge graph can represent the relationships between different agreements, parties, and terms.</p>

        <h2>What are the challenges of contract discovery in data lakes?</h2>

        <p>There are several challenges associated with contract discovery in data lakes. One challenge is that contracts can be unstructured and heterogeneous. This means they can be written in different formats and contain different data types.</p>

        <p>Another challenge is that contracts can be large and complex. This can make it difficult to extract the relevant information from them.</p>

        <p>Finally, contracts can be updated frequently. This means the contract discovery process must be automated and scalable to keep up with the changes.</p>

        <h2>How can these challenges be addressed?</h2>

        <p>There are several ways to address the challenges of contract discovery in data lakes. One way is to use NLP to extract keywords and phrases from contracts. This can help to identify the relevant information in the contracts.</p>

        <p>Another way to address the challenges is to use ML algorithms to classify contracts into different categories. This can help to organise the contracts and make them easier to search.</p>

        <p>Finally, data lakes can create a knowledge graph of contracts. This can help represent the relationships between agreements, parties, and terms. This can make it easier to find the relevant agreements and information.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>Data lakes can be a valuable tool for contract discovery. By using the right tools and techniques, organisations can automate the contract discovery process and find the relevant contracts they need. This can help organisations comply with regulations, manage risks, and improve their decision-making.</p>

        <p>Account executives are responsible for building and maintaining relationships with clients. One of the most critical aspects of this role is negotiating contracts. A well-negotiated contract can protect the client and the account executive and help the relationship flourish.</p>

        <h2>Tips for Account Executives Who Are Negotiating a Contract</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Do your research.</strong> Before you start negotiating, take the time to do your research. This includes understanding the client's needs, the market conditions, and the terms of similar contracts. The more information you have, the better prepared you will be to negotiate effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Be clear about your goals.</strong> What do you hope to achieve by negotiating the contract? Are you looking for a better price, more favourable terms, or something else? Once you know what you want, you can develop a strategy for achieving it.</li>
        <li><strong>Be prepared to walk away.</strong> It's essential to be willing to walk away from a negotiation if you're not getting what you want. This shows the client that you're serious about getting a good deal and can give you more leverage in the negotiation.</li>
        <li><strong>Be professional and respectful.</strong> Even though you're negotiating, being professional and respectful is always important. This will help to create a positive atmosphere and make it more likely that the negotiation will be successful.</li>
        <li><strong>Be willing to compromise.</strong> No contract will be perfect, so be prepared to compromise. The key is to find a balance that is fair to both parties.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Tips for Negotiating Specific Contract Clauses</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Price:</strong> When negotiating price, it's essential to consider the value of your services. What are your competitors charging? What are the market conditions? Be prepared to justify your price and explain why it's fair.</li>
        <li><strong>Term:</strong> The term of the contract is the length of time it will be in effect. This is an essential consideration for both the client and the account executive. The client will want to ensure enough time to get the most out of the services, while the account executive will want to ensure a long-term relationship with the client.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment terms:</strong> The payment terms specify how and when the client will pay for the services. This is an essential clause for the account executive to negotiate, as they want to ensure they will be delivered on time and in full.</li>
        <li><strong>Termination terms:</strong> The termination terms specify how either party can end the contract. This is an essential clause for both parties to negotiate, as they want to ensure they have the right to terminate the agreement if necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li> Be clear and concise in your communication.</li> 
        <li> Listen carefully to the client's concerns and objections.</li>          
        <li> Be willing to compromise, but don't give up on what's important to you.</li>
        <li> Get everything in writing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By following these tips, you can negotiate a fair and beneficial contract for both parties.

        <p>The procurement process is acquiring goods or services from a supplier. It can be a long and complex process, and there are many reasons why it might take longer than expected.</p>

        <h2>Reasons Why the Procurement Process Takes so Long</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Complexity of the purchase:</strong> The more complex the purchase, the longer the procurement process will take. This is because there is more information to gather, more decisions, and more people involved.</li>
        <li><strong>Number of stakeholders:</strong> The more stakeholders involved in the procurement process, the longer it will take. This is because everyone needs to be consulted and their needs met.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of clarity in requirements:</strong> If the requirements for the purchase are not precise, the procurement process will take longer. This is because the procurement team must clarify the requirements with the stakeholders.</li>
        <li><strong>Procurement policies and procedures:</strong> It will take longer if the procurement process is too rigid or bureaucratic. The procurement team must follow many rules and regulations, which can slow things down.</li>
        <li><strong>Vendor selection process:</strong> The vendor selection process can be long and drawn out, especially if there are a lot of qualified vendors. This is because the procurement team needs to carefully evaluate each vendor's proposal before deciding.</li>
        <li><strong>Negotiations:</strong> Negotiations with the vendor can also take a long time, especially if there are many complex issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Approvals:</strong> The procurement process can be slowed down by the need to get approvals from multiple people or departments.</li>
        <li><strong>Change requests:</strong> The procurement process can be derailed by change requests from the stakeholders. This is because every change request needs to be evaluated and approved, which can take time.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Tips for Speeding Up the Procurement Process</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Simplifying the process:</strong> The procurement process can be simplified by reducing the steps involved. This can be done by automating some steps or eliminating unnecessary steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Involving the right stakeholders:</strong> Only the essential stakeholders should be involved in the procurement process. This will help to reduce the number of people who need to be consulted and make decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Clearly defining the requirements:</strong> The requirements for the purchase should be clearly defined at the outset. This will help to avoid delays caused by misunderstandings or changes in requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Using a standard procurement process:</strong> Using a standard procurement process can help to ensure that the process is efficient and consistent.</li>
        <li><strong>Automating the procurement process:</strong> Some of the steps in the procurement process can be automated, which can help to speed things up.</li>
        <li><strong>Using technology:</strong> Technology can be used to improve the efficiency of the procurement process. This includes using e-procurement systems, online bidding platforms, and contract management software.</li>
        <li><strong>Training the procurement team:</strong> The procurement team should be trained on the procurement process and the best practices for speeding it up.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Be proactive and communicate regularly with all stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Set clear expectations and deadlines.</li>
        <li>Be flexible and willing to make changes as needed.</li>
        <li>Use a procurement management tool to track progress and identify potential delays.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By following these tips, you can help to ensure that the procurement process is as efficient and timely as possible.

        <p>Procurement contracts are long documents that outline the terms and conditions of a purchase agreement between a buyer and a seller. Negotiating can be complex and time-consuming, but they are essential for protecting both parties.</p>

        <h2>Reasons Why Procurement Contracts are so Long</h2>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>To cover all the details:</strong> Procurement contracts need to cover all the details of the purchase agreement, including the goods or services being purchased, the price, the terms of payment, the delivery schedule, and the warranty. This can be a lot of information; it is essential to be as specific as possible to avoid misunderstandings.</li>
        <li><strong>To protect both parties:</strong> Procurement contracts must protect the buyer and the seller. The buyer needs to be sure they are getting the goods or services they need at a fair price, and the seller needs to be sure they will be paid for their goods or services. The contract should include clauses like force majeure, dispute resolution, and termination.</li>
        <li><strong>To comply with regulations:</strong> Procurement contracts must comply with all applicable local and international regulations. This can add to the length of the contract, as the parties need to be sure that they are meeting all their legal obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>To be flexible:</strong> Procurement contracts must be flexible enough to accommodate market changes or the parties' needs. This can be difficult, but building some flexibility to amend the contract is essential.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other Things to Keep in Mind About Procurement Contracts</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>They are often written in legal jargon, making them difficult to understand.</li>
        <li>They can be expensive to negotiate and draft.</li>
        <li>They can be time-consuming to implement and manage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Negotiating a Procurement Contract</h2>

        <ul>
        <li>Do your research. Understand the goods or services you purchase, the market, and the terms of similar contracts.</li>
        <li>Be clear about your needs and objectives. What are you looking to achieve from the contract?</li>
        <li>Be prepared to compromise. No contract will be perfect, so be willing to negotiate on some terms.</li>
        <li>Get everything in writing. A well-written contract will protect both parties involved.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Despite their length, procurement contracts are essential to the business world. By understanding why they are so long and what they entail, businesses can be better prepared to negotiate and manage them effectively.</p>

        <p>The procurement department is responsible for acquiring goods and services for a company. They play a vital role in ensuring the company gets the best possible value for its money. A supplier must have a good relationship with the procurement department. This will help you to get your products or services in front of the right people and to negotiate favourable terms.</p>

        <h2>Tips for Having a Good Relationship with Procurement Departments</h2>
        
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Understand their needs.</strong> The first step to building a good procurement relationship is understanding their needs. What are they looking for in a supplier? What are their priorities? Once you understand their needs, you can tailor your approach accordingly.</li>
        <li><strong>Be responsive.</strong> Procurement departments are busy people. They don't have time to chase suppliers who are slow to respond. If you want to build a good relationship with them, respond to their requests promptly.</li>
        <li><strong>Be transparent.</strong> Be clear about your pricing and terms. Don't try to hide anything from the procurement department. They will appreciate your transparency and be more likely to trust you.</li>
        <li><strong>Be reliable.</strong> If you promise to deliver something, be sure to deliver it on time and in good condition. Procurement departments need to be able to rely on their suppliers. They will quickly lose faith in you if you can't be reliable.</li>
        <li><strong>Be flexible.</strong> Procurement departments are often under pressure to get the best possible deal. Be willing to negotiate and be flexible with your terms. This will show the procurement department that you will work with them to get a deal that works for both parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Build relationships.</strong> Don't just focus on the procurement department as a whole. Get to know the individual members of the team. Build relationships with them, and they will be more likely to go out of their way to help you.</li>
        <li><strong>Be patient.</strong> It takes time to build a good relationship with procurement departments. Don't expect to become their best friend overnight. Just be responsive, reliable, and flexible; they will eventually appreciate you.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Additional Tips</h2>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Be professional and courteous at all times.</li>
        <li>Be prepared to provide all the necessary documentation and information.</li>
        <li>Be willing to answer questions and address concerns.</li>
        <li>Be proactive and communicate regularly with the procurement department.</li>
        <li>Be willing to work with the procurement department to find solutions that meet your needs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        By following these tips, you can build a positive and productive relationship with procurement departments and get the desired results.

        <p>Contracts are essential for a modern economy. They allow businesses to make and keep agreements and protect both parties' interests. The oldest known contracts are a testament to the importance of contracts throughout history.</p>

        <h2>Oldest contract clay tablet</h2>
        
        <p> 
        The oldest known contract is a 4,000-year-old clay tablet found in modern-day Turkey. It is a marriage contract between a man named Laqipum and his bride, Hatala. The contract specifies the terms of the marriage, including the bride price, the dowry, and the rights and responsibilities of each spouse.
        </p>

        <p>The contract was written in cuneiform, a writing system used in ancient Mesopotamia. It is written in Akkadian, the language of the Akkadian Empire, which was located in what is now Iraq.</p>
        
        <p>The contract is dated to the 23rd century BC, during the reign of King Naram-Sin of Akkad. It is one of the earliest examples of a written contract that has survived to the present day.</p>
        
        <p>The contract is significant because it provides insights into ancient Mesopotamia's legal and social practices. It also shows that contracts were used in various contexts, even in the early days of civilisation.</p>
        
        <h2>Other ancient contracts</h2>

        <p>Document review is the process of examining documents to identify relevant, responsive, and privileged information. It is an essential part of the litigation process, as it helps attorneys to prepare for trial and to present their case to the court.</p>

        <p>There are many reasons why document review is important. Here are just a few:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>To identify relevant information.</strong> Document review can help attorneys identify relevant documents to their case. This is important because it helps narrow the scope of the case and focus on the most critical evidence.</li>
        <li><strong>To identify responsive information.</strong> Document review can also help attorneys identify documents responsive to discovery requests from the opposing party. This is important because it helps to ensure that all relevant information is disclosed.</li>
        <li><strong>To identify privileged information.</strong> Document review can also help attorneys identify privileged documents that cannot be disclosed to the opposing party. This is important because it protects the client's confidential information.</li>
        <li><strong>To prepare for trial.</strong> Document review helps attorneys prepare for trial by allowing them to review the evidence and develop their case.</li>
        <li><strong>To present their case to the court.</strong> Document review also helps attorneys to present their case to the court by allowing them to select the most important evidence and to prepare their arguments.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Document review can be time-consuming and expensive, but it is essential for successful litigation.</p>

        </ul>
        
        <p>In addition to the reasons listed above, document review is also essential for the following reasons:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>To comply with legal and regulatory requirements.</strong> Many industries are subject to regulations that require businesses to retain and review certain documents. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires publicly traded companies to retain and review all financial records for at least seven years.</li>
        <li><strong>To protect the business from litigation.</strong> Document review can help businesses to identify and address potential legal risks. For example, a business may review its contracts to identify potential breaches or employee policies to identify potential violations.</li>
        <li><strong>To improve the efficiency of the business.</strong> Document review can help businesses to identify and eliminate unnecessary or outdated documents. This can help improve the business's efficiency and reduce costs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Overall, document review is an essential process for any business. By regularly reviewing their documents, businesses can identify and address risks, comply with regulations, and improve efficiency.</p>

        <p>Document review is the process of examining documents to identify and extract relevant information. It is essential to many legal and business processes, such as litigation, due diligence, and research.</p>

        <p>The stages of document review vary depending on the specific context, but some general steps are common to most document reviews.</p>

        <h2>Planning</h2>

        <p>The first step in any document review is to develop a plan. This involves identifying the purpose of the review, the scope of the review, and the review methodology.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose of the review:</strong> What are you trying to achieve with the document review? Are you trying to identify specific information? Are you trying to assess the overall quality of the documents?</li>
        <li><strong>Scope of the review:</strong> What documents will be reviewed? What types of information are you looking for?</li>
        <li><strong>Review methodology:</strong> How will the documents be reviewed? What tools and resources will be used?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>

        <p>Once the plan is in place, the next step is to prepare the documents for review. This may involve organising the documents, converting them to a digital format, and indexing them.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Organising the documents:</strong> The documents should be organised to make it easy to find and review the relevant information. This may involve creating a document management system or using a spreadsheet to track the documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Converting the documents to a digital format:</strong> If the documents are not already digital, they must be converted. This will make it easier to review the documents using electronic tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Indexing the documents:</strong> Indexing the documents involves creating a searchable database of the documents. This will make it easier to find specific information in the documents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Review</h2>

        <p>This is the stage where the documents are actually reviewed. The reviewers will look for the information identified in the planning stage. They may also note any other relevant information that they find.</p>

        <ul>
        <li><strong>Reviewing the documents:</strong> The reviewers will typically read the documents carefully and take notes. They may also use electronic tools to search for specific information or to compare documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Noting relevant information:</strong> The reviewers will note any relevant information. This information may be used to create a summary of the documents, to identify trends, or to develop recommendations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Quality control</h2>

        <p>Once the documents have been reviewed, conducting a quality control check is important to ensure the review is thorough and accurate.</p>
            
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Quality control check:</strong> The quality control check may involve reviewing the reviewer notes, checking for consistency, and verifying the accuracy of the extracted information.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h2>Reporting</h2>
            
        <p>The final stage of the document review is to report on the findings. This may involve writing a summary of the documents, creating a database of the extracted information, or developing recommendations.</p>

        <p>AI can accelerate document review significantly. According to a study by Deloitte, AI can reduce the time it takes to review documents by up to 75%. This is because AI can automate many tasks involved in document review, such as identifying relevant documents, extracting key information, and flagging potential issues.</p>

        <p>Another study by McKinsey found that AI can improve the accuracy of document review by up to 10%. This is because AI can identify patterns and trends that humans may miss.</p>
        
        <p>AI is also becoming more sophisticated and affordable all the time. This means that more and more companies can take advantage of the benefits of AI-powered document review.</p>
        
        <p>Here are some specific examples of how AI can accelerate and improve document review:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifying relevant documents:</strong> AI can use natural language processing (NLP) to identify relevant documents from a large dataset. This can save reviewers a lot of time, as they no longer have to review every document manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Extracting key information:</strong> AI can use NLP to extract critical information from documents, such as names, dates, and addresses. This information can then be used to populate databases or generate reports.</li>
        <li><strong>Flagging potential issues:</strong> AI can be used to flag potential issues in documents, such as inconsistencies or suspicious activity. This can help reviewers to focus their attention on the most critical documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Improving accuracy:</strong> AI can improve document review accuracy by identifying patterns and trends humans may miss. For example, AI can identify documents likely to contain fraudulent activity or missing important information.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionise the way that document review is done. By automating many of the tasks involved in document review and improving accuracy, AI can save companies time and money.</p>

This is based on&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.

Which means more and more enterprises are able to use machine learning to automate, predict, plan, and personalize their products and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But does it mean you <strong>should</strong> build your own ML technology?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While actually building models has gotten easier, translating them from science projects into <strong>reliable, scalable</strong> software that brings businesses value is still hard.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What organizations really are missing is that these tools are </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">generic</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Developing and advancing them to meet niche industry or scenario needs, requires maturity, domain expertise and repeatability.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>General AI</strong> means that the models provided are not optimized for specific needs – be it <strong>legal or financial</strong>. This in turn means that these models need to be trained to understand domain specific content.&nbsp; As we saw before, this is the hard part: a time consuming process that starts from data collection and processing and proceeds to model training, testing and validating.

With increased business activity comes diversified contract activity — proposals to be formed, agreements to be negotiated and terms to be reviewed. Much of the work is supported by departmental stakeholders, internal analysts or with the help of external legal advisors or law firm partners.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stripped to the barebones, this sort of operational work invariably involves 3 phases:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ol> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Sourcing, identifying and analysing</strong> relevant information. For instance, during due diligence, legal and audit teams need to select the parts of the business that need to be audited, sourcing the contracts and financial documents that needed to be looked at;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Organizing information into understandable schemas</strong>: once collected, information needs to be sorted and much time is spent manually fitting data into existing schemas or systems. In the insurance industry for instance, customers fill claims in a variety of formats both on paper, online. Data needs to be organized in a standardised way so it’s easier to read, digest, store into DB for later analysis.&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Communicating</strong> the information to the relevant department and coordinating the work. Once the material has been processed and the information extracted, it needs to be sent to the relevant department for evaluation.&nbsp;</span></li> \n</ol> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To this date, much of the focus has been on enabling more of 3: organizational efficiency has been taking the center stage. But the greatest challenges – yet most anticipated value – is expected to come from how businesses do 1) and 2).&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses need to be handling documents and paperwork – only at greater volumes; parsing through the text and selecting important information – only faster, and structuring into machine-enabled, digital formats for further processing – only more automatically, and effectively.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And all of this whilst upkeeping or increasing accuracy and being able to compete at a lower cost.</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the areas where AI has been proving the most powerful- is at the intersection of <strong>Financial procurement, Legal Audit and Business Operations.</strong></span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>In these areas, AI proves to be a real game changer</strong>, offering endless capabilities to improve team and business operations when it comes to speed, accuracy and responsiveness, unlocking new efficiencies and enabling new ways of working.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think of -widely used- Document Management, Enterprise Content Management, Collaborative file storage systems that are the backbone of every organization. These systems are the infrastructure for knowledge management. Starting with files and documents, and enhancing them with AI is becoming a focus for many providers as they try to serve more needs for their client base. Actually, leveraging NLP capabilities could provide multi-directional ways of clustering and sorting data which would enable novel information flows within the knowledge management strategy.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, Contract Lifecycle Management technology provides lawyers with a single platform for negotiating, drafting and signing contracts – leading to substantial efficiency and cost savings. Integrating those capabilities with AI – for instance for contract review, redlining or clustering is a much needed feature and a path that some companies are starting to explore.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly&nbsp; ERPs, Analytics and Big Data platforms, and Workflow/Automation platforms are all prone to leverage the potential of AI.&nbsp;</span> </p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The harsh truth about AI&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how easy is it for companies to <strong>build their own AI platform</strong> or add new natural language processing capabilities to a product? The short answer is: <strong>it’s hard.</strong></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truth is, many AI projects fail. A </span><a href=\"https://www.capgemini.com/consulting/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2017/07/big_data_pov_03-02-15.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by Capgemini found that only 27% of enterprise data projects are successful, while Gartner predicted that </span><b>85 percent of AI projects won’t deliver</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Although open resources are widely available, building steady, scalable Artificial Intelligence solutions is by no means easy.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lack of data scientists is one of the reasons: the competition for qualified data talent is especially fierce – </span><a href=\"https://quanthub.com/data-scientist-shortage-2020/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">QuantHub</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rated “data science/analytics” as the second most difficult skill set to find (after “cybersecurity”).</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, the research and development phase is costly, long and requires multiple iterations. The annotation and training process, essential to any NLP application, is painstakingly t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ime-consuming.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a survey by data labelling company Alexion, 72% of the data scientists interviewed reported that Production-Level Model confidence will require more than 100,000 labeled data items.&nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to another survey by </span><a href=\"https://dotscience.com/assets/downloads/Dotscience_Survey-Report-2019.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DotScience</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 65% of companies said it’s taking them from 7 to 18 months to move their ML models from idea to production.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, even when you get it right, scaling up proves to be difficult and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the transition from software engineering into production environments that scale is rarely seamless. Having steady MLOps in place is critical and extremely difficult to achieve: a ML model requires constant monitoring and fine-tuning to make sure it performs optimally and stays updated. MLOps involves creating a machine learning pipeline to automate the retraining of existing models, optimizing the process reaching full efficiency.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This again requires time, costs and a fully dedicated team.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you commit to developing your own AI, you need to take into account a few factors: the time for building <strong>reliable, scalable AI</strong>; the cost for <strong>platforms and human resources</strong>; the opportunity cost of not being able to focus on your core business. Is it really worth it?&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Read <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/boost-your-product-with-artificial-intelligence-with-the-cognitiv-api-part-two/\">Part Two</a> of this blog post<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a> we have developed an <strong>Open and Extensible API</strong> for our domain-specific AI, ready for integration into any architecture.

        "post_body": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The impact of COVID will be far-reaching and, in the immediate term, has left many in real estate unsure about how to move forward.</span>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over the course of the pandemic, lockdown measures have been adopted by the UK and other countries across the globe at varying degrees and often included closing down large swaths of commercial properties.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the asset management firm </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amundi</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, retail was one of the segments hit most harshly by the pandemic due to the lockdown measures. Residential real estate on the other hand was also affected by the provisions of the UK Coronavirus Act 2020, which suspended a landlord’s right to take forfeiture action in case of missed payments.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a contract management perspective this involved the necessity to carefully evaluate the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">legal status</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> quo:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ensuring <strong>compliance</strong> with current law provisions</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Reviewing and analysing</strong> the leasehold agreements clauses and obligations</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, if necessary, <strong>renegotiating</strong> the leases terms</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, often under time pressure.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Book a free demo of our document review technology to speed up the negotiation process of lease agreements</h4>\n<strong>Contract clauses that UK landlords need to look at typically include:</strong>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Rent concessions</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;— </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a </span><a href=\"https://on24static.akamaized.net/event/26/37/37/2/rt/1/documents/resourceList1602021747617/mostnegotiatedtermsreport20201602021746560.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">report</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by World Commerce &amp; Contracting Association and iCertis, price was the second most negotiated contract term in 2020. Not dissimilarly, in real estate, the rent value has been on the forefront of renegotiation. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although tenants can request for a rent reduction or a renegotiation of the terms, English and Scots law does not require that landlords must accept the proposal in a commercial lease scenario. However, regarding commercial contracts, this is considered an evolving case law and landlords may experience reputational or commercial pressure to renegotiate lease terms toward a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> combination of a rent holiday, rent reduction and/or extended time to pay</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Insurance</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;—It’s not uncommon for tenants to pay a premium to landlords that cover insured risks. These insured risks will differ depending on the lease, so it is crucial for the tenant and landlord to review the agreement to verify if the pandemic does fall within the category of insured risks in the lease. In this case,&nbsp; the tenant may qualify for rent suspension by following a strict procedure as outlined by the lease agreement.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Keep open clause</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> —Keep open clauses&nbsp; oblige retail and other tenants to remain open for trading, often for avoiding the impact that closing a shop could have on the centre and surrounding commerce. Due to potential conflicts between the provisions of the lease and the government’s official guidelines and rules, these clauses incite disputes between involved parties and need to be carefully reviewed.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Health and safety</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;— Under&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.hse.gov.uk/leadership/legislation.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health and safety law</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tenants must consider threats to the health and safety of employees, while landlords have responsibilities to the extent they are in control of the premises. Health and safety law mandates that organisations must assess risks to employees, customers, partners, and others affected by their activities; arrange for the effective planning, organisation, control, monitoring, and review of preventive and protective measures; have a written health and safety policy if they employ five or more people; and consult employees about their risks at work and current preventive and protective measures. This would require a reassessment of internal policies&nbsp; and lease agreements to determine who is to bear the cost and the burden of health and safety compliance.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Withholding of rent</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the 2020 Health Protection Regulations, specified leisure and retail premises are required to be closed to members of the public. Landlords can also decide it’s safer and cost effective for the building to be closed, even if there is no legal requirement. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s debated whether tenants have the right to withhold payment of the rent in these cases, rather than resort to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">recovering damages for breach of covenant as a separate action. In these cases, the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> wording of the agreements need to be checked.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3>The advantages of AI for reviewing contract terms</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In all the cases mentioned above, being able to review the lease agreement portfolio at scale proves critical. However, manual&nbsp; review process is</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tedious, costly and time consuming.

Not easy and extremely time consuming</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;In fact, there is a whole system that manages these processes as efficiently as possible, Legal Operations. Quite a few processes fall under the umbrella of legal operations, but the most common include improving workflow, standardizing tasks, extracting critical information from documents and optimizing resources.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Removing the clerical and administrative work from the equation improves performance by positioning law professionals to focus primarily on the legal end. In addition to increasing overall productivity, legal operations reduces the reliance on external forms of legal counsel.</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><b>6 Key Responsibilities of legal operations professionals</b></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal operations professionals provide a variety of services, such as:</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<ol> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Strategise</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Develop actionable strategies and initiatives that bolster process workflows to increase productivity.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Define/track metrics</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Identify, incorporate, and track metrics to ensure that current or future processes provide clearly defined and measurable improvements.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Working cross-functionally</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Add value to a team by incorporating various expertise and skill sets to meet a common goal.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Optimisation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Effectively leverage the firm’s internal and external resources to improve performance and increase VFM (value for money).</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Tech-oriented solutions</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Integrate technology, such as AI, into processes to maximize productivity and decrease labour costs.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Spend management</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Manage outside legal counsel spend by maintaining visibility of spend, pursue opportunities to reduce cost, and budgeting.</span></li> \n</ol> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><b>Improving legal operations with artificial intelligence</b></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence enables a whole suite of solutions to streamline legal operations by cutting down on time, cost, labour, and stress.</span></p> \n<p><b>Time and cost</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The automation of repetitive tasks with machine learning technology can drastically reduce the time required to identify and analyze relevant contract provisions. Unlike conventional labour, artificial intelligence maintains a consistent pace and reviews each line of text with the same degree of focus and effectiveness from start to finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a>’s highly accurate machine learning technology can identify and analyze relevant contract provisions, resulting in customer-reported time savings of 30–70%.</span></p> \n<p><b>Risk mitigation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span><b>&nbsp;</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risks come in all shapes and sizes but share one key characteristic: they are costly. Artificial intelligence can offer a <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/artificial-intelligence-risk-mitigator\">360-degree approach to risk mitigation</a> and can maintain an efficiency that is out of reach for conventional contract analysis. Artificial intelligence also addresses these three common problems:</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<ol> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Human error</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Large workloads can make even the most seasoned associate slip up and make a mistake. For example, with M&amp;A due diligence projects, associates are often tasked to review a sea of contracts to catch potential criticalities. These requests are often paired with a tight deadline and require an intense level of focus that inevitably diminishes due to tedium.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Availability bias</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Unfortunately, this is a common problem plaguing the due diligence process that stems from only reviewing about 10</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20% of a contract pool. More often than not, critical information is overlooked or outright missed until after the M&amp;A process. Artificial intelligence remedies this by affording associates the means to analyse an entire contract pool.&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Identifying new info</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Artificial intelligence can review documents with a larger degree of efficiency to catch inconsistent elements. Document review technology can even point out potential instances of fraud by identifying changes in the patterns of invoices over a select timeframe or an uncommonly invoiced item.</span></li> \n</ol> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><b>Establish a data-driven approach</b></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Document review powered by Artificial intelligence excels in extracting crucial information from legal documents. Some examples of extractable data include prices, fees as well as termination dates. Further, this data can be used to help anticipate the collection of late fees or the renewal/termination of contracts.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a> technology allows for extraction of data at scale, while you can use your domain-specific parameters and develop <a href=\"/product\">custom Machine Learning (ML) models</a> for legal insight extraction without the need of data-scientists</span></p> \n<p><b>Workflow optimization</b></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence is most effective when used as an integrated solution.&nbsp;The right application programming interface offers the best of both worlds by allowing you to enhance preexisting systems or create a new one with machine learning technology as the foundation. Cognitiv+ API allows for fast integration with existing DMS systems and other technology.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><b>Cognitiv+ Features</b></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitiv+ is an AI-powered document review platform that allows for fast and accurate document analysis, data extraction and risk assessment.

        "post_body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial Intelligence has been on the legal scene for a few years now – but it’s still uncommon to find legal technology solutions focused solely on<strong> property law</strong>. </span></p>\n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are AI-powered solutions that range from legal research to contract management but they haven’t been designed to cater to the needs of a particular legal niche. This is critical, because different legal sectors have their own set of challenges and requirements.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Proptech is a growing sector, with innovative AI-powered technology designed for&nbsp; improving the management and development of real estate. But again, only few PropTech solutions take lawyers into account. More often, PropTech focuses on maintenance and management of premises – though a fusion of IoT and AI capabilities. <strong>Little attention has been given to the legal “side” of every property business</strong>: negotiation, due diligence, deal management, monitoring of the contracts portfolio.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neglected both by PropTech and LegalTech, real estate lawyers needed our support. We could not remain indifferent.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in all truth, there are a number of ways real estate lawyers can benefit from the untapped potential of Artificial Intelligence. To name a few: automating the document review process, extracting relevant information, and ensuring compliance with existing regulations by speeding up their review, identifying relevant obligations and legal amendments, flagging discrepancies with existing corporate policies: all activities that lawyers have to carry out, in high volumes, repeatedly. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Document review</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agreements are the bread and butter of real estate lawyers and attentive document review, during a due diligence process, negotiation or sales process is both time consuming and error prone. Artificial Intelligence-powered document review allows for a faster, more-attentive analysis of the document and summarises the results in an easily digestible format.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"/\"><strong>Cognitiv+</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; intelligent document review technology is trained to read contracts and recognise major data insights from main contract models. Our technology can also extract obligations and rank them on the basis of their severity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3>Lease Abstraction</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/what-is-lease-abstraction/\">lease abstract</a> is a document that real estate lawyers know pretty well: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an easily navigable document which includes the most relevant legal and financial information included in a lease agreement: basically a summary of the lease, with the most important data outlined for easy and quick review.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophisticated artificial intelligence technology like Cognitiv+ makes it possible to create accurate lease abstracts automatically and at scale.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI l</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ease abstraction technology is trained to recognise major data insights within lease agreements such as:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Names of the tenant(s) and landlord</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Address and square footage of the space</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rent&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ground rent</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Service charges</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether the tenant has right of first refusal</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Termination Clause</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rent indexation</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real estate taxes</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And many other Covid-19 relevant clauses</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Regulatory Compliance</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowing the relevant regulations that are going to impact on the real estate sector – – is essential.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means being able to navigate complex regulatory instruments looking for the provisions that apply to your case: for instance the <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/summarizing-uk-coronavirus-act-2020-with-cognitiv/\">Coronavirus Act 2020</a> contains a large number of sections of which only a handful impact, albeit strongly, the real estate sector.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cognitiv+ Artificial Intelligence technology has been trained to review and identify relevant obligations from existing regulations.&nbsp; The neural translation system makes it possible to translate from 50 other languages into English, allowing you to process and understand foreign legislation.</span></p>\n<h3>Personalisation</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being able to analyse particular documents and extract only the clauses and provisions that matter for your business is equally important.

        "post_body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An artificial intelligence-powered platform for tackling repapering? Distilled into its most basic form, repapering is defined as a large remediation of documentation that involves risk assessing, amending, and migrating contracts — often employed by financial service institutions and insurance companies. Further, this process aids in contingency planning or relocation. For companies operating on the global stage, repapering is an inescapable reality that businesses must adapt to.</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent example that highlights the necessity of an effective repapering platform involves <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/the-impact-of-brexit-on-commercial-contracts/\">Brexit</a>, in which a no-deal Brexit meant that (without the correct paperwork) UK companies could no longer be allowed to provides goods and services to EU27. Another example is <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/there-is-life-after-libor\">LIBOR, the benchmark set to expire in 2021</a>, which is embedded into almost all financial contracts with a variable interest rate component.</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>The obstacles of repapering</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the immense undertaking that repaper characteristically entails, conducting this process manually is extremely labour, resource and time-intensive. One of the most difficult aspects of this is the coordination and cooperation of finance, legal, and operations teams who are tasked to discover and assess relevant contracts and clauses. Couple this with a high likelihood for human error, and manual repapering is less than ideal.</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another underappreciated issue brought about by manual repapering is that the process is growing increasingly complex. In turn, the human element of repapering scales poorly in comparison to increasing demands and a sometimes seemingly endless workload. Although some legal teams can attempt to manually manage repapering through sampling, it adds needless and expensive risk that can be mitigated by simply using a repapering platform.</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>How Cognitiv+ platform can help with repapering – 5 key features</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"/product/\">Cognitiv+</a> &nbsp;provides a platform that takes the pain away from the challenges of repapering: reviewing the dataset of agreements, identifying the ones that require remediation, carrying out a throughout risk assessment, and determining the relevant clauses or sections that need to be amended.

Can artificial intelligence document review help?&nbsp;</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) are fixed-income investment products that are backed by mortgages on commercial properties. A fairly sophisticated product, they are heavily regulated to ensure transparency of the product itself and the underlying assets. Due diligence becomes a pivotal moment in the creation and assessment of CMBS and can be carried out in the phase that precedes the creation of the bond, or later when it’s time to evaluate the investment in existing securities.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>The Issues with Manual Due Diligence</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The due diligence process consists of a review of the mortgages, debtors, and underlying properties that make up the asset pool backed in the securitisation; it can also include assessing the reliability of the originator of the CMBS.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due diligence becomes essential to ensure transparency and provide the market with confidence in the investments being offered.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>A Granular Process</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due diligence must be performed at a very granular level and includes reviewing the loan documents of the mortgages, together with the collateral documents related to the property, as well as&nbsp; all other documents that can help assess the integrity of the originator.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As any due diligence process, it suffers from 3 major setbacks</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is time consuming – as each and every agreement needs to be reviewed manually, looking for key clauses, highlighting them, and extracting them in a separate document for easy access.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is resource heavy – several lawyers need to be involved in the process, which in turn, means the expense linked to the due diligence can be substantial.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s risky – substantial risks can be missed or underestimated. On the one hand, repetitive activities are generally error-prone. In addition to the inevitability of human error, the due diligence process never takes into consideration all of the underlying assets, but usually focuses on a limited sample of the overall pool of contracts.&nbsp;</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No manual due diligence process can be said to be 100% accurate and risk-free when it comes to evaluating sensitive investment vehicles like CMBS.&nbsp;</span></p> <a href=\"/contact\" style=\"border-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(241, 149, 43); display: inline-block; max-width: max-content; text-align: center; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; margin: 0.5em; color: whitesmoke; border-radius: 0.5rem; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 400; transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out 0s;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.backgroundColor='#f1952b95'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.backgroundColor='#f1952b'\">Get a FREE Demo of Cognitiv+ Technology</a> <h3>How AI-Powered Document Review Comes to the Rescue</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since due diligence for CMBS must be performed at a very granular level, the entity that carries out the analysis focuses on 4 main areas underlying the security: loan agreements, borrowers, originators, properties.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-powered tools like <a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a> are able to automate the process and substantially enhance the review and data retrieval for each and every phase.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan due diligence involves looking for key clauses and provisions in loan agreements.

Can artificial intelligence reduce the time, cost, and compliance risk involved by the RTS?</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RTS are just the latest step in a series of provisions to enhance transparency to the market of securities in the EU: following the Securitisation Regulation (Regulation 2017/2402), the EU Commission has then laid down the Reporting Technical Standards in the </span><a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32020R1228&amp;from=EN\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/1228</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that became effective on September 23, 2020.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technical standards detail the requirements that financial institutions need to comply with when disclosing information about their securities to investors. The EU Commission has provided <strong>15 pre-made templates</strong> developed by the European Security Market Authority (ESMA) of the precise requirements that need to be complied with. The templates show the detailed loan-level information that each financial institution (originator, sponsor, or SSPE) must provide to its investors. These include commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is a much needed move, it also adds further constraints to financial institutions, paired with the necessity to comply in a short timeframe.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to extract loan-level data from all the existing agreements and fill up the corresponding reporting templates? Artificial intelligence proves to be a much needed ally to automate this process, making due diligence and reporting more effective, less risky, and much less time consuming.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>The New Reporting Guidelines and Template Requirements</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Securitisation Regulation requires financial institutions to <strong>provide periodic reporting of information on the underlying assets of the securitisation.&nbsp;</strong></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reporting Technical Standards set out the <strong>granularity of the information to be disclosed</strong>: underlying exposure-level data can be extremely useful for investors and to adequately understand and monitor the risk and performance of securities.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RTS has established that the disclosure must happen by using prescribed reporting templates, developed by ESMA, which must be used to make any new information available about a securitisation in accordance with Article 7 of the Securitisation Regulation. ESMA has even published guidance on how to complete the disclosure templates in its </span><a href=\"https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma33-128-563_questions_and_answers_on_securitisation.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Q&amp;A Document on Securitisation Topics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Or perhaps you are on the </span><a href=\"/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitiv+</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog… Read on.</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ground rents are the income paid to the freeholder of a property from a long-term leaseholder. They are due yearly and are relatively small, typically 200-400£ per year, depending on the location and value of the property.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ground rents become interesting when they are viewed as an alternative form of investment: they are paid yearly, they are paid for a long period of time, and an important feature is that they provide a good, steady, low risk yield.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The risk is lower compared to traditional commercial or residential leases, because the leaseholder has a strong incentive to pay the ground rent rather than forfeit the property .&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, <strong>monitoring</strong> ground rent clauses in a large portfolio of agreements can be <strong>particularly challenging</strong>. This is where Artificial Intelligence-powered lease abstraction technology can help.</span></p> \n<h3>Monitoring the Portfolio of Leasehold Agreements</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ground rents are typically small, and they need to be aggregated in order to guarantee a meaningful investment. This means managing a large portfolio of properties, which eventually boils down to having to manage a large portfolio of contracts.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The harsh reality about real estate agreements is that they come in different shapes and formats – paper agreements often digitized in a rush, together with pdfs, pngs, jpgs and word docs. Standardization is rarely common in real estate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need the information contained in these agreements to be&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available for fast review</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Searchable</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Easy to access</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Translated into machine readable format</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, what you get is:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having to wade through many different documents&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having to manually search and review what you need</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having to accept the risk that checking every single document is impossible</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the pain points that real estate professionals, lawyers, and investors bring to us.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Why is it Important to be Able to Navigate and Review your Lease Agreement Portfolio quickly?</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having the helicopter view of your investments, how they are differentiated, and how they are changing overtime is an obvious value. The same thing is true for the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lease</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> agreements underlying your investment.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may need to know:</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the aggregate value of your ground rents for all of your portfolio?</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How is the ground rent value likely to change over time?&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the risk associated with these changes?</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did we say change? Yes.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although less flexible than traditional rents, ground rents can increase or decrease in a number of cases.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, the parties may have agreed that the ground rent could increase if:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is referenced to inflation measures – i.e. retail price index or consumer price index.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be adjusted to the market rent value (open market review).</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It should increase a fixed amount within a certain number of years.&nbsp;</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that the investment is growing – or it’s likely to grow – at a certain point in time. This information should be promptly available.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time the ground rent can decrease – or disappear completely, for a few reasons:</span></p> \n<p><b>Enfranchisement&nbsp;</b></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enfranchisement allows leaseholders to purchase a freehold which can lead to an alteration of the initially expected cash flow profile. However, this can be mitigated when purchasing ground rents for flats rather than houses, since all of the lessees in a block of flats must agree to the enfranchisement.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><b>Lease Extensions</b></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The leaseholder can have the right to buy an extension of their existing lease, which in some cases, according to statutory provisions, means that there could be no future ground rent payable for a term of 90 years, plus the remaining term of the existing lease. However, the parties can negotiate different terms for lease extensions in the agreement. Another way to decrease lease extension risks can be making sure that the lease has a long term.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>COVID19</strong> has created an additional layer of uncertainty in the area of ground rent payments. Since the pandemic has begun, leaseholders have been increasingly requesting concessions, payment plans, waivers, or deferral of charges. Landlords may be wanting to renegotiate their terms or allow amendments, which in turn affects the investment.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contract language has a direct consequence on the investment, and is why it is important to review exactly what the contract clauses say.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long is the lease term? Is there a clause covering lease extensions? Is this a leasehold for a flat or a house – aka how likely it is that the lessee is going to exercise enfranchisement rights?

They hide in the shape of -apparently harmless- acronyms, like Covid-19, GDPR, Brexit, IFRS-16, MiFID2.</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They mean massive regulatory production and amendments and an <strong>increased compliance risk</strong> for your organisation. A regulatory storm usually means trouble and additional work for compliance officers.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can artificial intelligence come to the rescue by accelerating regulatory review and reducing compliance risk? </span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter the </span><strong><a href=\"/product\">RegBox</a></strong>: regulatory compliance made easy.</p> \n<h3>What do regulatory storms look like?<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a compliance officer, there are a number of issues you have to face when regulatory storms hit. In our experience, these are the most common:</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New laws are enacted and <strong>need to be implemented</strong> ‒ sometimes at very short notice: you need to be able to read and understand them quickly.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New laws amend previous laws, and it’s difficult to <strong>keep track of the regulatory changes</strong>.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good old habit of <strong>cross-referencing</strong> laws is still very much alive ‒ it’s difficult to map and understand the network of references and visualise it at a glance.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s time-consuming to translate new regulatory requirements into<strong> policies</strong> for the company and update existing policies.&nbsp;</span></li> \n</ul> \n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1886 size-full\" src=\"/lib/img/blog/covid-graphic-cognitiv-e1600703823372.png\" alt=\"cognitiv+ regbox \" \"></h3> \n<h3>How can artificial intelligence help compliance officers?</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"/product\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RegBox</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a machine-learning powered technology, <strong>designed to accelerate regulatory compliance</strong>. We built it with real-life issues in mind that compliance officers face every day.</span></p> \n<h3>I need to go through a multitude of provisions <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‒ </span>which ones are relevant for my company?</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We designed the <a href=\"/product/\">RegBox </a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to facilitate the assessment of current and emerging regulations.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our machine-learning technology can review documents, turn them into a machine-readable format and <strong>identify the provisions that matter</strong> for your company, sector or audience. The relevant provisions will then be extracted into a Word document, Excel file or they will flow into your </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GRC system.</span></p> \n<h3>How do I understand what I need to do?<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href=\"/product\">RegBox</a> is the only machine-learning document review system that is able to <strong>identify and extract your obligations</strong> from any regulatory text. Our technology will rank the relevant obligations </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and assign a colour based on their severity: high, medium or low. Think of it as a traffic light system for deliverables!</span></p> \n<h3>How do I keep track of regulatory amendments?</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through our regulatory comparison technology, <a href=\"/product\">RegBox</a> is able to compare and <strong>highlight regulatory amendments</strong>. The RegBox can automatically highlight regulatory changes, pinpointing any changes and anomalies and summarising them in a redlined document.</span></p> \n<h3>A law refers to a clause in another law, which refers to a clause in another law…</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-references make regulatory analysis time-consuming. This means endless clicks and having to keep several tabs open in order to get ‘the big picture’, with the added risk of getting lost in the web of citations. We designed the <a href=\"/product\">RegBox</a> to make <strong>cross-referencing easy to map</strong> and follow with an intuitive visualisation system.</span></p> \n<h3>How do I easily update company policies?</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We understand that your job as a compliance officer involves translating regulatory requirements into company policies. It’s your job to help all of the people in your company to understand the difference between ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. However, drafting policies is time-consuming and it’s not uncommon to draft new policies that are similar to previous ones, failing to accurately represent new risks and requirements.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the <a href=\"/product/\">RegBox</a>, it is easy to evaluate the impact of new regulatory requirements on your existing policies. Our <strong>groundbreaking tool</strong> can understand, extract and cluster risks, compare those with your existing policies and make it easy to update them.</span></p> \n<h3>Our offer to Global RegTech Summit participants</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are facing new regulatory storms or simply making sense of the new regulations that come up regularly in your industry, we would like to help.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are providing a number of demos to selected participants in the <strong>Global RegTech Summit</strong>.

We think the definition should also include a congenital love for numbers, a sensuous thrill when finding others’ mistakes and the enviable ability to stand an extremely tedious dayjob.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But repetitive activities are error prone and even for auditors with the highest “Audit IQ”, reviewing large amounts of data within a short time frame, with little or no time remaining to focus on high-level activities, can be challenging. Can automation and artificial intelligence come in handy here?</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is an <strong>endless stream of data that is created, collected, and processed every day</strong>, including financial statements, tax work papers, invoices, returns. Performing an audit is growing more difficult: the amount of meaningful data to process has been increasing; more labour is required to effectively process it, while the time available remains the same. Assigning more eyes on paper may be enough to keep up (for now), however, it is not a winning strategy in the long run.</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Instilling trust with a proven solution</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Auditors offer their characteristically critical eye while investigating a company’s financial statements to provide an honest and measured audit opinion to the capital markets. However, given the exponential increase in information to dissect, analyze, and interpret, instilling trust in the veracity of an audit’s findings and conclusions is a difficult task.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to its demonstrated efficiency, the push for organizations to integrate AI into every application possible has been a well-established practice for quite some time. In fact, many have already employed artificial intelligence in auditing to <strong>sift through data points</strong>, such as contracts, expenses, and receivables.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A prime example where artificial intelligence is an indispensable asset for auditors is <a href=\"https://www.ifrs.org/issued-standards/list-of-standards/ifrs-16-leases/\">IFRS 16</a>. This international standard for reporting shapes how companies can account for leases in their financial disclosures. As a result, an auditor may need to review thousands of lease contracts from numerous organizations and extract the relevant information that needs to flow into the financial statements.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine learning technology analyze</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s and recognises major data insights and key </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clauses in lease contracts and allows for the extraction of other information critical to an audit.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>AI reduces time-intensive routine tasks and allows auditors to focus on data analysis and interpretation</strong>.</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Clean and comprehensive auditing</h3> \n<p><a href=\"/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitiv+</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’s core features enable auditors to outsource the most time-consuming and repetitive aspects of reviewing financial documents and compiling information.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><strong>Features</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Review acceleration</em>: Cognitiv+ automatically <strong>reviews documents at scale</strong> and <strong>extracts key points</strong>, creating a clear summary that can be exported in a structured and searchable Excel table.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Document Comparison</em>: Cognitiv+ uses artificial intelligence to <strong>compare new documents against a database of known and approved documents</strong>, flagging differences and identifying potential issues.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Uses&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being able to extract and visualize important data means that it’s easier to detect changes in patterns, potentially identifying critical issues. For instance, the software can help detect changes in patterns of invoices over time like unusual invoiced items, quantities or amounts based on previous history.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technology can also analyse entire sets of expenses, categorise them and potentially expose non-authorised claims.</span></p> \n<p><a href=\"/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitiv+</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is ready-for-use right out the gate but can be personalized, so users can select to identify and extract specific items from contracts and financial documents.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An increased level of customization that allows the software to automatically recognize user-specified provisions. With the software’s ability to be fine-tuned to handle an outsourceable task, auditors can focus on providing a more detailed analysis in crucial areas of review.</span></p> \n<h3>The bright side of an abundance of data</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the sheer amount of data to process may seem like only another obstacle for auditors to overcome, with the right tools, it provides the opportunity to create more precise audits than previously thought possible.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Artificial intelligence in auditing offers a scalable solution that is specifically designed to help auditors stay ahead of the curve by positioning them in front of the data.</span></p>",

Every corporate department has a number of tasks that are:</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repetitive and consistent, with the same step being performed repeatedly;&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Particularly prone to human error.&nbsp;</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These features make the perfect environment for automation.&nbsp;</span></p> <a href=\"/contact\" style=\"border-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(241, 149, 43); display: inline-block; max-width: max-content; text-align: center; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; margin: 0.5em; color: whitesmoke; border-radius: 0.5rem; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 400; transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out 0s;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.backgroundColor='#f1952b95'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.backgroundColor='#f1952b'\">Request Demo</a> \n<h3>What areas can be improved through the use of AI document review?</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few areas where consultants can leverage the <strong>power of AI document review.</strong></span></p> \n<p><strong>Accounting</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to </span><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/finance/insights/robotics-in-finance\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gartner</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 89% of general accounting operations could be highly automatable. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI-powered document review technology is able to analyse <strong>entire sets of documents</strong> – from expenses to invoices, extract relevant text and collect it in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a repository where the extracted data can be stored, manipulated and supplemented with additional data.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><strong>Auditing&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Auditing can benefit from automated document review – <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/finance/insights/robotics-in-finance\">Gartner</a> estimates </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">72% of financial </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">controlling</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could end up </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">being automatized</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in some way or another</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For instance, AI document review technology can be leveraged to <strong>identify indications of fraud</strong>, just by reviewing changes in patterns of invoices over time or unusual invoiced items.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><strong>Sales</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sales process, although traditionally a more “creative” one, can be supported through the use of machine learning powered document review.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main friction points before sealing a deal with a client, is <strong>identifying potential risks in the draft agreement</strong>, before it is submitted to the analysis of the legal department – that very often ends up flagging criticalities and ends up slowing the clients onboarding. Some document review systems allow for comparing the contract against a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> database of known and approved contracts,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> identifying deviations in standard clauses, reducing the risk and expediting the approval process by the legal department.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitiv+’s <a href=\"/contract-comparison\">Contract Comparison</a> feature can match any new document with a list of pre-vetted documents and automatically highlight differences, pinpointing any changes and anomalies and summarizing them in a redlined document.</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitiv+’s Contract Comparison feature can match any new document with a list of pre-vetted documents and automatically highlight differences</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>HR&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HR departments deal with contracts – a lot of them –&nbsp; and AI can help with<strong> identifying key information in employment agreements</strong>, such as salary, restrictions on annual leaves, and terms and termination clauses</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be classified, interpreted, and extracted. Data from contracts can be integrated with data from the company’s payroll.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Data Department</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the area where machine learning document review and extraction technology can prove all their versatility. As tasks can vary wildly according to the data science project, there may be the need to <strong>retrain the machine learning algorithm</strong> in</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">–</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">house for each new task. Not many document review technologies offer this capability.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"/product\">Cognitiv+ GrayBox</a> is a customizable, easy to use solution </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that allows </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ata </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cientists to build </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">d</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eep </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">l</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earning models in a fraction of the time than with traditional data science methods.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We dubbed it “Deep Learning for the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">M</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">asses”.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>No tech is an island, entire of itself</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, artificial intelligence technology is not a magic wand, it is just one of the many tools that</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consultants and companies </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">utilize</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to improve their processes and solve their – very real – problems.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integrating the technology into an existing workflow becomes as important as the capabilities of that technology.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integrating AI technology into a company’s processes requires accurate planning – doing RPA right means that companies can’t be left alone with an expensive toy in their hands, but need to be guided in the discovery and implementation process. To put it simply.

        "post_body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covid-19 has dramatically affected real estate. We directly saw it because one of our clients, whom we will call “RealAlity” (invented name, of course!), had to face the full power of the Covid-19 crisis.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RealAlity owns a wide portfolio of commercial premises all over the UK, and internationally. As the pandemic struck, it’s no news that 90% of retailers had to temporarily shut down. As the lockdown progressed, temporary closures ended up being permanent for those that could not afford to be in business anymore.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a landlord of commercial premises means to be able to handle each of those cases differently, which in turn means looking at the contract as a necessary starting point for every renegotiation.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put it simply, RealAlity was asking itself:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are my rights and duties in the event of a pandemic?</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the rights and duties of the lessee?&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is Covid-19 to be considered a case of force majeure?&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Does the lessee have to pay the rent or are there any rental holiday clauses?&nbsp;</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There wasn’t, of course, an univocal answer to those questions – in many cases, as lawyers like to say, the answer is “it depends”. It depends on what the agreement says.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, reviewing a large number of agreements to decipher the terms of the agreement and&nbsp; find out what is possible to do – and what are the basis of a possible renegotiation with the lessee, takes time. An incredible amount of time.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were called to help with a herculean task, to solve their issue, fast.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Issue #1 – Documents in multiple formats</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first issue that RealAlity was facing was that their agreements were stored in a multiplicity of formats. Many of the agreements were in non-readable formats: originally in paper form, they were scanned in a rush during a digitalisation project. They were in most cases, pngs or jpegs or pdfs.&nbsp; Many others were in Word – which is the favourite format of lawyers, indeed.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step in every technology that involves artificial intelligence is to make <strong>any document into machine readable form</strong>. This was possible thanks to a technology called Optical Character Recognition – for reference, OCR – that enables you to convert different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF files or images into editable and searchable data. We decided to make OCR a constitutive part of<a href=\"/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Cognitiv+</a> .&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We were able to process the documents and turn them into machine readable form for our software to do its magic. Next, how do you find the right clauses?&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Issue #2 – identifying relevant clauses at scale</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RealAlity needed to identify <strong>all of the clauses that mattered during the Covid-19 pandemic</strong>, so that they could potentially be leveraged for a renegotiation of the agreements.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Force majeure</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardship clauses</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unoccupied premises&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rent free period-rental holiday clauses</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assignment Clauses</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forfeiture Clauses</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our<a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/what-is-lease-abstraction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> lease abstraction</a> tool is an AI-enhanced technology that can recognize key obligations and clauses from leases and tenancy agreements, and extract them. The final product is the lease abstract: in an easily navigable document – usually in Excel or Word format, which includes the most relevant legal and financial information included in the lease agreement, together with a clear breakdown of each parties’ obligations.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once we understood the RealAlity requirements, we trained the software to recognize and extract all the clauses that they wanted to identify and extract for quicker reference.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the documents were uploaded, the OCR technology transformed the agreement into a machine-readable file and the artificial intelligence system sifted through the contract looking for relevant provisions, extracting them into an Excel file.</span></p> \n<h3>Benefits of Lease Abstraction in Real Estate</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lease abstraction provided 3 fundamental benefits to RealAlity:</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Risk mitigation</strong>. The possibility to comply with all aspects of their leases and understand their rights and duties substantially reduced the chance of making mistakes</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Integration</strong>. Our lease abstraction technology could integrate and work together with RealAlity’s proprietary software to track important dates/events and set reminders, for instance for collecting late fees, interest, rent, maintenance costs or increased renewal rates.</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Strategic decision</strong>. Lease abstracts can be leveraged to provide a wide range of information necessary to make strategic decisions, to assess whether the portfolio is adequately diversified and for creating value.</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Download your copy of the <a href=\"/product\">Lease Abstraction</a> Whitepaper</p>",

        "post_body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wealth management firms need to face an ever changing regulatory landscape: GDPR, MiFID II and more recently, the retirement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, which can make compliance complicated and asks for a massive repapering excercise. Can artificial intelligence-powered contract analytics technology help with repapering? Wait…what is contract analytics?</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<h3>The Problem for Portfolio Managers</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2021, the London Interbank Offered Rate – LIBOR is set to expire. The rate is included in a large number of financial agreements – which will need to be reviewed, interpreted and possibly amended.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many financial institutions, including wealth management firms, need to tackle the <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/there-is-life-after-libor/\">transition from LIBOR</a> to alternative rates.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem and the risk associated with it, is that this process implies reviewing a very large number of documents: fund holdings, investment agreements, associate fund documentation and the likes. The task is made more challenging because you need to identify not only documents that contain express references to LIBOR, but also the ones which are directly or indirectly linked to those contracts – i.e. credit agreements, bond indentures, derivative confirmations.Last but not least, documents are very rarely in a machine readable format – more often they consist of scanned files of paper documents.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you work in wealth management you are probably already aware of all this. The situation seems quite bleak, doesn’t it?&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>How automated contract analytics can help wealth management firms</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is that Contract Analytics technology can accelerate the review phase and reduce the overall compliance risk associated with document review. Enters the hero… (Sorry for replicating the same patterns of many celebrative blog posts.)&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contract analytics is a machine learning powered technology that can review a large number of agreements and identify explicit or implicit instances of LIBOR – or any other benchmark – in the contract.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>The process would look something like this</strong>.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <strong>triage</strong> phase would be needed to risk assess the existing documents and divide them into different groups.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Triaging&nbsp; may consist of dividing contracts into:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contracts which are terminating before 2021 – as LIBOR is ending after that date, these contracts would expire naturally;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contracts that expressly identify a replacement benchmark, such as SOFR or SONIA;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contracts that do not&nbsp; identify a replacement rate;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contracts that are linked to agreements containing a LIBOR rate.</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The triage phase is the most critical and can be streamlined using artificial intelligence- powered contract analytics technology. Best contract analytics software makes it possible to recognize variance in standard contracting language – “understanding” when a contract is referring to LIBOR or an alternative rate – even when that specific wording is not used.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contract Analytics technology is able to:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ul> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Convert all documents – pfd, word, pngs, jpegs – into machine readable formats;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify all the clauses containing occurrences of LIBOR or of alternative references;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify the contracts set to expire before 2021;</span></li> \n <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify clauses that referred to external, connected agreements.</span></li> \n</ul> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once automatically subdivided into risk groups, contracts also need to be<strong> interpreted</strong>: for instance, if existing rate adjustment provisions provide sufficient guidance on replacement rates, or whether the contract must undergo an amendment or full repapering process.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Download your free copy of the </span><a href=\"/product\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LIBOR Whitepaper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to understand how Cognitiv+ Technology can help. </span></p>",

Generalization refers to the model’s ability to adapt to previously unknown data. This problem occurs not only when there is not enough data but also when the data are not representative enough. Thus, machine learning engineers have to be certain that the available data represents the entire distribution of the problem that needs to be solved. Having more representative examples of the group of objects that may be encountered will lead to more accurate predictions.</span></p> \n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Low-quality data </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Before designing a complex algorithm, machine learning engineers always need to carefully examine the data. Specifically, data usually contain <strong>outliers, noise, and irrelevant examples</strong> so if not handled correctly, the predictions will most likely be flawed.</span></p> \n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Domain-specific representations </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The features that are given as input to the model should <strong>be aligned with the task’s domain.</strong> For instance, in Natural Language Processing, words are usually represented by word embeddings. Commonly used <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec\">Word2Vec</a> embeddings are trained on general-purpose corpora, thus not performing well enough on specific domain tasks. <a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a> has trained domain-specific embeddings and has proved that they give a significant gain to the overall performance.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3></h3> \n<h3>Model</h3> \n<p><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">The model that is used for prediction and insight extraction should be carefully selected and trained.</span></p> \n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Model overfit </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Overfitting happens when the machine learning model represents the training data too well. More precisely, the model learns the detail and noise in the training data causing poor performance on unseen data. <strong>Overfitting leads to a model with low generalization capability</strong> and is one common reason why models fail in production.</span></p> \n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Model selection </span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">There is <strong>not a single model that performs well across different machine learning tasks</strong>.

        "post_body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common Law vs Civil Law: are common lawyers a different beast than civil lawyers? Is the way we use legal tech going to be affected? In this blog, conveniently titled “Common Law, Civil Law and Legal Tech, we’ve jotted down some ideas for you to consider.</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comparative Law 101: common law and civil law contracts are different.&nbsp;</span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re already familiar with this, feel free to skip to the last paragraph. Otherwise, keep on reading, while we try to sum up some basic concepts.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Common law contracts are different from civil law contracts</strong>: common law contracts are usually longer and more detailed. Civil law contracts tend to be shorter. Yes, probably you know that already.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The generally accepted explanation is that (we are simplifying, this is supposed to be a blog post after all): Civil law drafters are able to rely on a well defined set of codified, default rules, that produce the background on which the drafter can create the contract. <strong>These rules are contained in a magic book that all continental jurisdictions call the Civil Code</strong> (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, Code civil, Codice Civile etc). The Civil Code contains a series of provisions that rule several&nbsp; areas of private law – contracts, property, torts and so on. The Civil Code rules apply by default.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a consequence, if, when drafting a contract, the parties forget to indicate a certain scenario, the rules included in the Civil Code apply. This makes it possible, at least according to conventional wisdom, to draft very minimal contracts – everything that the parties did not define is going to be covered anyway by the application of one or more rules of the Code.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common law contracts are usually longer and more detailed. Civil law contracts tend to be shorter.”</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, the force majeure clause – that exonerates the parties in case of a major, unexpected event- is present in all common law contracts but could be left out, with little or no consequence, from a civil law contract.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The force majeure provisions will apply even if the agreement does not contain a force majeure clause: the parties’ responsibility to perform the contract would be waived in case of an unexpected event that makes performance impossible. On the contrary, in the common law style contracts, the parties have to specify (in the contract) events of force majeure that will exclude their liability for nonperformance. That should explain why the force majeure clauses in common law are often very long and cover as many events as possible.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The differences in common law vs. civil law drafting became much more nuanced with the advent of big law firms – which have been imposing a sort of a multinational legal lingua franca, usually of the common law type. Long, detailed contracts became usual in civil law countries as well: in international transactions and particularly in the field of&nbsp; M&amp;A, it became the norm to use “common law style” contracts even if both parties, or companies, are continental.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Legal English has become the vehicle language of international business even in countries belonging to the civil law family”, (</span><a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/151161045.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Martina Kunnecke</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One reason: the ubiquitous anglosaxon law firms can impose their own language as a sort of lex mercatoria; but also, the absence of an effective international contract law that could uniform the law of contracts between two entities located in different countries has forced the parties to rely on longer agreements.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Long contracts are necessary to define the obligations of the parties when the rules of a single code can’t be applied- and that’s always the case in international private law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;“A Way to Stabilizing Expectations Through Typified Solutions” as </span><a href=\"https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=291017116081003114097029082072017069055063001016012032102067121104008064111023123007027096058007119109030023071119002110123027041042078020060029077064125094003015038019076091086103116010115098067069029112091019027120093031080092126091125122119081029&amp;EXT=pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Flood and Fabian P. Sosa</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> once beautifully put it.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Civil Lawyers Who Speak Common Law</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another phenomenon started to arise:<strong> the use of Common law language by Civil lawyers</strong> and together with it, the use of legal English by non-native speakers of English.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And when you put together common law legal concepts + a civil law frame of mind/legal culture + English as a second language, you get a very interesting mix.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are indeed, a number of terms and concepts that become problematic when used or interpreted by civil lawyers.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, take the concept of warranty, which is often used in the sentence “represents and warrants”. For a common lawyer, this clause simply means that a party “states” something. For a civil lawyer, the word “warrants” brings to mind the whole universe of “product warranties” in the sale of good contracts. This gives rise to confusion: is the party providing a warranty or just stating something?&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“In contracts for the sale of goods, warranty can be used, as a matter of the law of warranties, to refer not only to a statement of fact but also to an obligation. The sentence is so confusing that </span><a href=\"https://www.adamsdrafting.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Adams-Eliminating-the-Phrase-Represents-and-Warrants-from-Contracts.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kenneth A. Adams</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, set to eliminate it completely from agreements, in favour of the more plain “states”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“There are indeed, a number of terms and concepts that become problematic when used or interpreted by civil lawyers.”</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The penalty clause gives rise to similar </span><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265244573_Civil_Law_and_Common_Law_Two_Different_Paths_Leading_to_the_Same_Goal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">confusion</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp; The civil law term “<em>clause penale</em>” (French), “<em>clausola penale</em>” (Italian) or “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>cláusula penal</em>” (Spanish)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> looks deceivingly similar to “penalty clause”, but these clauses have -legally speaking different- meanings. Clause penale is a clause that determines the amount of damage one party has to pay to the other in case of non execution or breach of the contract (it is inserted in the contract so that the party does not have to actually prove the damages). The common law equivalent would be a “liquidated damage clause”. A penalty clause is a different kind of beast, and lawyers insert it in a contract with the only aim being to deter the other party, because the amount fixed is usually exorbitant compared to the actual damage suffered and penalty clauses tend not to be enforced by courts.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, the correct English translation of <em>clause penale</em> would be “liquidated damages clause” and not “penalty clause”.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The examples could go on. The field is tricky as any lawyer who dabbles in two systems, legal translator or legal comparatist knows: tricky because it has to do with different legal systems, legal cultures, frames of mind, and lack of uniform law.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Common law, civil law and legal tech</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right, for a while we forgot that we are on a legal tech blog.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So here comes the question: <strong>is legal tech taking differences in legal cultures and languages into account?&nbsp;</strong></span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some legal tech deals with words (document automation). Some legal tech relies on Natural Language Processing, which deals with syntactic and semantic structures of a language ( <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/cognitiv-features-in-a-nutshell-contract-review/\">AI-powered document review</a>, e-discovery) .</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The point is that <strong>the divide between common law and civil law has some relevant consequences on the way we use legal tech.</strong> Legal tech is not a magic wand, it’s just a product. It can be AI-powered, but that doesn’t make it able to handle complex legal issues (yet).&nbsp;</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “The divide between common law and civil law has some relevant consequences on the way we use legal tech”</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is particularly important for document review technology – which is <a href=\"/product\">what we build</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For document review software, the <strong>training phase</strong> is pivotal – not only because AI algorithms obviously rely on training to function – but because the type of contracts (i.e. lease agreements, service agreements, NDAs) and clients’ needs substantially differ from one another.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When training a machine-learning document review software it is important to determine, together with the clients, what provisions the software should look at, and what kind of contracts it should analyze, but also: <strong>have the agreements been drafted in a common law or civil law system?</strong> Have they been drafted by civil lawyers or common lawyers? The trainers should be aware of the differences in the language used (i.e. “represents and warrants” doesn’t indicate a warranty clause; if I want to flag how much money the parties can be awarded, I should be looking for a “liquidated damages clause” not a “penalty clause” and so on).&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <strong>interpretation phase</strong> is equally important. Once the training phase is over, the real game begins, and the software is used to extract provisions and obligations at scale from the agreements. Who is going to read the results and are they interpreted through a common or a civil law pair of lenses?&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People have started talking about algorithm bias focusing mostly on the ethical point of view and within reason, but algorithms may be biased when trained within a certain legal culture and applied to a different legal culture as well. Keeping it in mind during the whole process is important.</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>About Cognitiv+: </strong><a href=\"/\"><strong>Cognitiv+</strong></a> is the artificial intelligence platform that empowers businesses and law firms with deeper insights on their legal data.</p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "post_body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"/blog/tag/lease-abstraction\">Lease abstraction</a> is a substantial document review technology made for the real estate world. Lease Abstraction is built on technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), optical character recognition (OCR), and machine learning (ML), to automate the capture and extraction of relevant data elements.</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lease abstraction software has been trained to recognize key obligations and clauses specifically from real estate agreements: lease, sale, tenancy agreements, and so on.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lease abstraction software automatically extracts specified key provisions and distills them into the final product, the lease abstract: an easily navigable document – usually in Excel or Word format, which includes the most relevant legal and financial information included in the agreement. The lease abstract also includes a breakdown of the parties’ obligations and references to the original agreement.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why Lease Abstraction is Important</span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lease abstract<strong> makes it easy to review and understand the main points of a contract</strong>, at a glance, without the need to read long, tedious agreements and it also reduces the time and costs involved with contract review. Automated lease abstraction is useful for at least 3 reasons:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Volume:</strong> Extracting clauses and obligations from an agreement that can be hundreds of pages long is a tedious, complex task. Landlords, banks, property managers or other companies may find themselves managing a large portfolio of lease agreements and needing to process an incredible amount of data, both in physical and digital formats.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Diversity:</strong> Agreements vary in terms of clauses, content, obligations, and terms used. The wording used for the same concept can be different across jurisdictions or even firms.&nbsp; Regulatory requirements can also substantially vary across different jurisdictions and be incorporated into the agreements. Contracts can be drafted in different languages. Last but not least, they can be stored in different formats: word documents, pdfs, images or paper.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Accuracy:</strong> When contract review and data extraction are performed manually, the risk for mistakes is higher. If the operation has to be performed under a time constraint, the risk for mistake becomes even higher.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> <a href=\"/product\" style=\"border-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(241, 149, 43); display: inline-block; max-width: max-content; text-align: center; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; margin: 0.5em; color: whitesmoke; border-radius: 0.5rem; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: 400; transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out 0s;\" onmouseover=\"this.style.backgroundColor='#f1952b95'\" onmouseout=\"this.style.backgroundColor='#f1952b'\">Download the Lease Abstraction Whitepaper</a>  \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Technology Behind Lease Abstraction</span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lease Abstraction is based on advanced Artificial Intelligence algorithms – which involves a training phase of the algorithm and an evaluation phase.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Document scanning</strong> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tool scans the agreements – converting Word or pdf documents into machine readable HTML. if the software is powered with OCR technology, it’s also possible to process scanned paper documents and image files.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><strong>Training phase&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lease abstraction software needs to be trained to understand and review sets of agreements. Training involves using NLP techniques to annotate a set of documents. The accuracy of the system is clearly proportional to the amount of time invested in training, and to the volume and variety of datasets supplied. This is because the more varied a data set is, the more likely the technology will be able to capture grammatically similar sentences, synonyms, and so on.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Self-learning phase </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a subset of the training phase: if the technology relies on machine- learning algorithms, it will be able to effectively detect newer language variations and identify new lease nomenclature, basically “auto-training” itself.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Evaluation</strong> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The training phase is followed by a verification phase, where the extracted datasets are evaluated by humans and corrected if necessary.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Execution</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the training and evaluation phases are completed, the lease abstraction software is ready to work and identify a number of selected clauses in the agreements it reviews. The provisions and the obligations are then extracted and exported into the lease abstract, that can consist of an Excel or Word document.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Integration</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most advanced lease abstraction tools also offer the capability to integrate with any existing workflow, DMS or ERP. The extracted data can automatically flow into the lease management system, making it easy to review through an API.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">—</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a></strong> lease abstraction solution is a <strong>machine learning technology that has been trained to identify the most common and sensitive provisions and obligations in lease agreements</strong>,&nbsp; guaranteeing accuracy, facilitating interpretation of contract clauses, and mitigating financial and legal risks. The OCR technology allows for upload of documents in many formats (image scans, in addition to pdfs and Word docs), while the neural translation module allows for easy translation of +50 languages into English.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>Want to know more?

        "post_body": "<p>All businesses use contracts to regulate their dealings. For many firms, this may include a significant volume and variety of documents, covering most aspects of the business. <strong>In the event of a proposed regulatory change, going through all these documents to identify relevant provisions will be both expensive and time-consuming.</strong><br> Two recent events have had a major impact on the real estate dealings of businesses around the world.</p> \n<!--more-->\n<p>Firstly,<strong> the global coronavirus pandemic has resulted in the implementation of lockdown measures</strong> in many countries that require commercial premises to close for the duration of the lockdown. Accordingly, it has become important for businesses leasing premises to establish precisely their rights and responsibilities during this time, as well as those of their landlords.</p> \n<p>Further, in 2016, the International Accounting Standards Board published<strong> a new accounting standard for leases, IFRS 16,</strong> taking effect on 1 January 2019. This new standard requires lessees to recognise most leases on their balance sheet; a significant departure from IFRS 17. Companies across the globe were required to examine all their legal documents containing leases in order to comply with these regulations – not a simple task when potentially thousands of documents are involved, traversing jurisdictions and languages, and where some contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components.</p> \n<p>These events highlight the reality of operating a business in an increasingly globalised world: <strong>compliance with regulations has become more complex</strong>, as global events influence domestic rules and international regulations affect local companies. More than ever, businesses need to find a way to comply without incurring too much expense or wasting too much time.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>Compliance with regulations has become more complex, as global events influence domestic rules and international regulations affect local companies.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The use of artificial intelligence to abstract, review, identify and extract key provisions from a lease provides a clear solution to the problem of balancing compliance requirements with the <strong>need to maximise efficiency in a business by saving time and money</strong>.</p> \n<p>The <strong><a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/what-is-lease-abstraction/\">lease abstraction</a> software</strong> developed by <strong><a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a></strong> is an example of this type of solution.</p> \n<p>The team at <a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a> employs their expertise in <strong>natural language processing, vision AI and deep learning</strong> to create a suite of products to improve value extraction from legal documents. In relation to lease abstraction, features of the software include <strong>automatic analysis of lessor and lessee obligations including prohibitions, discretions and deliverables, and automatic extraction of key leasehold clauses</strong>.</p> \n<p>For a quick breakdown of how the software works, firstly any lease documents will be duplicated in an identical digital format, allowing information to be captured in its original format, retaining legal integrity. This will also <strong>allow companies to have a full digitally elastic search of their leases</strong>. The contents will be extracted, and the results presented in a filterable Excel spreadsheet, or a summary in Microsoft Word.<br> Extracts from the lease can be merged into a letter, report or notice. Importantly in the context of lease documents embedded into a larger contract, the system will continue to improve in accuracy over time through the use of the artificial intelligence allowing it to be “trained” by staff.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>Features of the software include automatic analysis of lessor and lessee obligations including prohibitions, discretions and deliverables, and automatic extraction of key leasehold clauses.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>While lease abstraction through artificial intelligence can provide many benefits to businesses, it involves some challenges. There are various legal technology solutions available that incorporate artificial intelligence but choosing the most suitable solution may require an <strong>understanding of not only the business’ needs, but how these needs will interact with the technology.</strong> Further, implementing any new technology within a business is always potentially challenging; even more so when that technology is different from the enterprise resource planning or contract lifecycle software most staff may be accustomed to. The difficulty experienced in overcoming these challenges will differ between businesses, depending on general levels of technological literacy and experience with implementing these solutions.</p> \n<p>It is with these challenges in mind that <a href=\"https://syke.tech/\">SYKE</a> was created in 2016, with a mission to support the transformation of the global legal industry in an increasingly digitalised world. The fastest growing independent legal technology firm in the world, <strong><a href=\"https://syke.tech/\">SYKE</a> helps law firms and corporate in-house legal teams to choose, buy and implement legal technology</strong>, in addition to developing legal technology solutions internally.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>The most suitable solution may require an understanding of not only the business’ needs, but how these needs will interact with the technology</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://syke.tech/\">SYKE</a>’s team of <strong>legal engineers is made up entirely of lawyers or ex-lawyers,</strong> it is able to provide end-to-end support and advice to businesses based on their own experience of the market. This allows businesses to reap the benefits of implementing these solutions, while avoiding the challenges outlined above. Further, as<a href=\"https://syke.tech/\"> SYKE</a> retains a product-agnostic approach to procurement, businesses can be assured that the most appropriate tools for their needs will be selected. Its global team of legal engineers, based in the UK, Europe, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and India, bring their experience of working in different countries and in different languages to each project, allowing for a nuanced understanding of how firms operate in various contexts.</p> \n<p>Addressing both the benefits and challenges of using artificial intelligence to abstract provisions from leases, <a href=\"https://syke.tech/\">SYKE</a> and <a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a> are well positioned to help businesses to navigate the complexities of operating in a global, digital environment.

A few days ago, the U.K. declared it </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has no intention to extend the transition period further than 31st December 2020. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.K. left the EU on 31st January 2020, and the EU law will continue to apply to the U.K. only until the end of the transition period, as stated in the Withdrawal Agreement.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is going to happen after, and how is Brexit going to impact on your commercial contracts?&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>What to look out for</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the end of the transition period, the EU Treaties, EU free movement rights and the general principles of EU law (such as the single market and the customs union) will cease to apply in the U.K. Prior EU regulations will continue to apply in U.K. law until they are modified or revoked by U.K. regulations.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s very important to determine if Brexit is going to have an impact on existing contracts, on which specifical clauses, and if there are grounds for renegotiation.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Points and clauses you should pay attention to include:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><b>Increased trade barriers: </b>It seems unavoidable that Brexit will cause an increase in trade barriers and costs. You may want to renegotiate your agreements or reassess your position.</p> \n<p><b>Movement of persons: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The freedom of movement of citizens between the U.K. and the EU could be impacted, which is relevant for companies operating in the service industry. Assess if limitations to the freedom of movement are likely to affect your current contracts.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><b>Currency fluctuations: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pound vs. Euros fluctuations are another possibility, albeit maybe even trickier to forecast. You may want to ascertain if heavy fluctuations may give rise to the application of force majeure, hardship, material adverse changes and the likes.</span></p> \n<p><b>Territorial scope: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your agreements have the EU as territorial scope, they will need to be amended to reflect the exit of the U.K. from the EU territory.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><b>Parallel regulatory regime: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your commercial agreements regard the provision of goods and services on both the U.K. and EU markets, this may involve the existence of two parallel regulatory regimes.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><b>Change in law: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What should be considered the applicable law to the contract?&nbsp; Are there explicit references to EU legislation or principles?&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spotting these provisions and evaluating the obligations that may arise is not always easy, especially if the formulation of the contract is not explicit.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Automated contract review to the rescue</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reviewing commercial agreements is one of the activities a law firm should take into account as Brexit is approaching.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manually reviewing agreements though is extremely time consuming. It is repetitive, and also tends to be more error prone. Reviewing your commercial agreements in the light of the Brexit changes, entails a substantial dose of risk: the risk of overlooking important provisions and, consequently the risk of a normative vacuum or a substantive imbalance in rights and duties after the transition period is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine learning contract review technologies like <a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a> allow for automated, intelligent analysis of the existing contracts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitiv+ can review large volumes of contracts and highlight the information that should be analysed and considered in the light of possible changes due to Brexit.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine learning contract review technologies&nbsp;allow for automated, intelligent analysis of the existing contracts. </span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitiv+ technologies consists of an “out of the box” solution, the <a href=\"/product\">Review Platform</a>, and a highly customizable solution, the <a href=\"/product/\">GrayBox</a>. The GrayBox can be trained to recognize the clauses, provisions and obligations within your commercial agreements that are more likely to be impacted by Brexit, on the basis of the goods or services you provide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After an initial training phase, where Cognitiv+ artificial intelligence system “learns” to identify all those explicit and implicit sections which are “Brexit-sensitive”, the software is ready to skim a large number of agreements to look for those parts that need attention.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The software is also able to extract the obligations arising from the contract and assign a level of criticality, making it easy to understand what sections need to be addressed first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, the results can be extracted into Word and Excel files for an easier, “helicopter view” of the matter.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It needs to be found fast, and easily, because in legal proceedings </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">time is of the essence</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp; Oh, and there’s a lot of it in every law firm; as <a href=\"http://www.tangledom.com/\">Kate Simpson</a> – one of the first at embarking on the delicate task of legal knowledge manager –&nbsp; put it, because lawyers know that information is important “they are loathe to delete anything (just in case)…”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to critical, time-sensitive information, there are briefs, precedents, regulations, templates, and agreements. There is also content that is&nbsp; produced externally and internally, legal content and content which is not strictly legal, like quotes, pitches, and internal emails. There can also be content produced across several offices of the same firm, or according to multiple processes, duplicated content, and so on.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what does Legal Knowledge Management entail?&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Elements of Legal Knowledge Management: Taxonomies</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal knowledge management is certainly much indebted to information architecture and law librarianship. We don’t hear them mentioned too often when we review the area of legal knowledge management, but they are there. Indeed, Legal KM is also designing the strategy behind the way we order and categorize legal information, it’s about creating and developing taxonomies.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taxonomies are indeed, one of the first strategies that lawyers use to organize information. Before search engines became fashionable and information could be digitized, legal taxonomies played a role in making legal information searchable and retrievable.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also played a role in legal education. The common lawyer may not be acquainted with the history of Roman Law as much as civil lawyers are. They may have heard, however, that the taxonomy behind many of the European Civil Codes – persons, property and obligations – is much indebted – and quite similar – to a </span><a href=\"https://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=jcls\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">taxonomy originally developed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the mythical legal teacher Gaius, and then used by Emperor Justinianus in his Institutiones, a book written not for lawyers but for law students, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cupida legum iuventus </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">– young people eager to study the law, and make sense in the tangle of Roman Law.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Taxonomies are one of the first strategies that lawyers use to organize information.”</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the U.S., common lawyers certainly are acquainted with another kind of taxonomy: the </span><a href=\"https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/insights/articles/using-the-west-key-numbers-system\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">West Key Number System</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a tool for finding case law which was developed in 1908 and can be navigated in two ways: using headnotes from a case to find similar cases or by browsing the West Key Number System, where each number corresponds to a legal topic. There are more than </span><a href=\"https://lawrepository.ualr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1141&amp;context=faculty_scholarship\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">100,000 individual key numbers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, grouped in 400 topics and themselves grouped into higher level categories: 1. Persons, 2. Property, 3. Contracts, 4. Torts, 5. Crimes, 6. Remedies, and 7. Government. Since it’s about case law, it keeps on growing and developing and each new relevant precedent is fitted into the existing taxonomy.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, search engines make the task of retrieving information much easier – more on this later – but taxonomies are still very much alive and not only for organizing case law or regulations.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Actually, the divide between the way lawyers organize laws and case law and the way they treat their own material can be surprising. As </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.priweb.com/betterlawfirms.htm\">Marc Lauritsen</a>, of Capstone Practice Systems, put it:&nbsp; “For a profession that grew up with intricately (some might say compulsively) structured treatises and case reporters, it is ironic that practicing lawyers devote so little energy to organizing the materials and tools with which they practice. Taxonomies need to be front and center as we move into an era of greater knowledge tool use.”</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taxonomies require subject matter expertise and information management expertise, but they also need to be built on a consensus: not everyone gives the same meaning to the same categories; it depends on the culture, the training, and experience. Lawyers trained in different legal systems can call the same things by different names.&nbsp; In this sense, leveraging </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">user research is pivotal when building a legal taxonomy, and there is much to learn from the methodology of user experience design.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not just about taxonomies. It’s about other classificators like tags, facets, and metadata that add information and complexity to the schema and facilitate efficient retrieval.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Elements of Legal Knowledge Management: Systems and Tools</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Old law librarians had to rely on categories and paper. The modern legal knowledge manager can count on a number of IT tools, at least since LegalTech has entered the field.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Legal Search Engines</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal search engines are the first, most obvious application of technology to legal information retrieval. Indeed, IT legal databases have come into fashion with the rise of personal computers since the ‘80s, while web browser interfaces have been used in legal search since the late ‘90s. In the last 10 years, natural language processing and machine learning have enhanced traditional legal search technologies, making it possible to figure out users’ intent and provide more detailed, richer and precise answers.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Ediscovery tools</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EDiscovery involves looking through the sheer amount of information that is exchanged during the first phase of a litigation procedure. This information may include important evidence – and it’s therefore pivotal that it’s done right. Machine learning and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">predictive coding heavily enhance this area as well. It’s possible now to train the technology behind Ediscovery to teach it what to look at on the basis of previous documents that were classified before as relevant or irrelevant by the lawyers.</span></p> \n<p><strong>Document Automation&nbsp;</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating information, as much as finding it and sorting it, is part of a legal knowledge management strategy. And because a good part of creating templates and agreements in law firms can be replicated and repeated – this area has proven to be ripe for automation. Document automation software is certainly part of a KM system. Not only because it improves and speeds up the creation of new information, but because it enhances the process behind the creation and allows a clear trail record – no more back and forth of legal drafts in word documents – all the drafting, editing and signing can be done using the same platform.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><strong>Automated Document Review</strong></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Document research takes on a new significance with automated document review software.&nbsp; This is certainly a constitutive part of a legal knowledge management strategy. Think about it as legal search on steroids. Machine learning document review technologies allow for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">identifying key pieces of information in a large number of legal documents – agreements or regulations -and extracting it. The system can be trained to identify only information that is considered relevant in a particular sector. For instance, if the process to be carried out is due diligence, AI-powered document automation tools can be trained to identify clauses and provisions that are the most critical in a due diligence process, like liability, indemnity, force majeure, and change of control. If the documents that the legal team is looking at are lease agreements, though, the focus can be shifted toward identifying and extracting key information like terms, rent, renewal, base rent, and maintenance obligations. The system can also recognize and detail the level of severity of each clause, intuitively telling lawyers where they should focus.</span></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The modern legal knowledge manager can count on a number of IT tools, since LegalTech has entered the field”</span></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine learning document review technologies also allow for automated extraction of key clauses, redlining, or comparison with documents previously approved by the legal team – to identify differences and in doing so, potential criticalities. Most advanced systems also provide for automated neural translation of documents from various languages.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these technologies can work together in a legal knowledge management system; the task of the Knowledge manager is to choose the right set of tools, selected on the basis of the firm’s needs, map the processes and mostly, integrate all these tools in a coherent process. I said it. The keyword must be </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">integration</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if a document is processed through a contract review system and then is edited, it has to be possible to refeed it into the system and reprocess it, seamlessly.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these technologies should be able to work together and integrate with the existing document management system that the law firm is using. They must fit into the firms’ </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;lifecycle processes of creating, storing, publishing, and finding documents.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern legal knowledge managers have the responsibility of&nbsp; bringing together the past and future: sourcing upon centuries of taxonomic expertise, and combining it with the latest advancements in legal technology to finally distill it into a unified, seamless picture.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a></strong> is a machine learning document review platform that reviews, identifies and extracts key provisions from corporate and legal documents. Through its API, <a href=\"/product\">Cognitiv+</a> can be seamlessly integrated with existing DMS or ERP systems and other legal tech solutions.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><a href=\"/contact\">Schedule a Demo</a></strong></p>",

We had the chance to talk about it </span><a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/pandemic-a-testbed-for-legal-tech/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some time ago</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: the Covid-19 pandemic has forced many law firms to switch to remote working.</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/blog/future-of-law/coronavirus-remote-working-and-the-virtual-law-firm\">Remote work</a> relies on using a series of technologies.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>First,</strong> technologies that enable audio and video communication: Zoom, Skype, google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams and the like.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Second,</strong> instant messaging tools that enable fast, casual communications like Slack and similar.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Third,</strong> project management software that makes it possible to; keep track of the team progress, assign tasks, track time and give partial solace to the worst control freaks: Monday, Trello, and Asana are a few of the software programs available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Fourth,</strong> cloud-based solutions that enable file sharing with other remote teams, like Google Drive or&nbsp; DropBox.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Covid-19 is impacting Legal Knowledge Management</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many ways to look at this phenomenon. We don’t know if it’s here to stay, like some have claimed. Certainly, though, Covid-19 has severely impacted not only the way law firms work, but also the way they produce, share and store information. If this can sound like a platitude, we could try to rephrase it. Covid-19 has impacted the way law firms are conducting legal knowledge management.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/pandemic-a-testbed-for-legal-tech\">previous post</a>, we discussed the concept of Legal Knowledge Management and why it is so important for law firms.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law firms produce or store a vast amount of content – some of this content is sensitive or critical – it could consist of briefs, evidence or reports important to a legal proceeding. It could consist of case law, laws and secondary regulations.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law firms organize this content using a taxonomy and relying on IT tools that make organization and retrieval easier and more effective. They map the processes that underlie information creation, checking who produces what, and where the content produced should be stored.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is remote working forcing law firms to reconsider their legal knowledge management strategy? Things are changing along 3 lines:&nbsp;</span></p> \n<ol> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of the quantity and type of the information produced: new content also consists of chats, video calls recordings, and short messages exchanged in the project management software itself.&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the way that information is stored: files and documents are in the cloud instead of being on the intranet, in a pc folder or worse, on paper.&nbsp;</span></li> \n <li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the way the information production workflow is working:&nbsp; it may be necessary to redefine who produces what and how- who is taking notes during calls, or is it better to just record the call?&nbsp;</span></li> \n</ol> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<h3>Legal Knowledge Management pet peeve: Systems integration</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remote working also made another issue even more pressing. It increased the number of platforms that lawyers are using to do their job, and made the necessity for seamless integration even more real.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In <a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/pandemic-a-testbed-for-legal-tech\">our previous post</a>, we analyzed how a multiplicity of legal technology tools, legal databases, DMS, document automation software, and AI document review tech need to function together as much as possible.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we add more tools, namely video and chat software, project management, and cloud networks, the necessity for making sure that this system works together in sweet harmony is even greater. This is both a responsibility for legal knowledge managers – choosing the right technology – and for legal tech companies – enabling API and designing for open integration as much as possible.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p>&nbsp;</p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a> is a machine learning document review platform that reviews, identifies and extracts key provisions from corporate and legal documents.

For some, this has meant adopting generalistic tools like Zoom, Slack, Google Drive and the likes. For others, specific legal tech solutions like </span><a href=\"https://www.lawyersweekly.com.au/biglaw/28091-why-legal-tech-is-crucial-for-team-success-during-a-pandemic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">practice management software</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>“Sudden and abrupt work from home has caused many legal professions to learn new software and ways of working”</em> </span>says<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ron Friedmann.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Technology entered the law firm – lawyers have been forced to switch.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>But how big of a switch is this?</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Zoom instead of a meeting room can be a starting point, but really doesn’t add to turning law firms into hi-tech hubs.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are cases where moving toward a more comprehensive technology doesn’t come that easy.&nbsp; For firms which are still heavily paper-based, the adoption of cloud-based knowledge management systems can’t be improvised overnight.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many firms are still limited to computer systems that operate only within an office. Many are not even that far along, still relying heavily on paper filing systems. They have virtually no infrastructure for their staff to work offsite and virtually no clue of where to start.” </span></em><a href=\"https://abovethelaw.com/2020/03/coronavirus-could-be-tipping-point-for-tech-competence-in-law/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">writes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bob Ambrogi.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these cases, the move toward technology is more difficult, more expensive and more time-consuming. However,&nbsp; if the effects of the pandemic linger on for a few more months – or possibly years – and the lockdown gets extended, reinstated or turned on and off, implementing some radical legal technology changes appears very much needed.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The necessity to work remotely is boosting law firms toward considering the adoption of some legal tech. If it’s enough of a boost, I don’t know.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Then there’s another aspect: free time.</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workloads have dramatically shrunk, and clients have paused or cancelled projects.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this has forced many to look for more clients, other jobs or additional sources of revenue to stay afloat, it has given others an opportunity to learn or gain additional expertise.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I talked with several of my acquaintances – they found themselves with a lot of spare time on their hands.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, they decided to use the spare time in the best way they could – studying. Learning. Keeping up with the legislative changes.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Trying out a new legal tech, for the ones that have been toying with the idea, was the next step during the pandemic.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">E-discovery, document automation, AI document analysis and review, legal research software and the like. Part of the reason why some lawyers haven’t yet approached some of this technology had to do with the – sometimes steep – learning curve associated with it.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.lawsociety.org.uk/support-services/research-trends/lawtech-adoption-report/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Law Society</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, lack of skills and low levels of awareness and confidence are among the barriers to limited adoption of law tech solutions by UK law firms.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the pandemic is changing the way lawyers work, at least for now. Is embracing technology a “matter of immediate survival” as Bob Ambrogi puts it? I’m not sure. I guess it depends on the technology.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s say it’s a good opportunity to get lawyers acquainted with the idea of technology and a chance to get them mingled with some good legal tech.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And perhaps even a litmus test for many of these legal tech solutions – the ones that deliver real value are here to stay.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><b>Pandemic is a testbed for legal tech.&nbsp;</b></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And of course, that’s true for us as well, as we have skin in the game: if you’re interested in playing out with our document automation technology,</span><a href=\"/contact\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> give us a call or request a demo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>",

        "post_body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As lawyers, we often think of Artificial Intelligence as a risk — maybe one not worth taking.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is probably because the very term artificial intelligence still carries (for some of us) that subtle dystopian sci-fi flair, oscillating between Isaac Asimov and 2001: A Space Odyssey.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what if AI was instead, a risk mitigator?</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Take due diligence for instance.</strong> Carrying out an M&amp;A due diligence project is not only costly and time-consuming, it also involves a substantial amount of risk.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>First, the risk of human error.</strong> In M&amp;A due diligence projects, associates are asked to review a sheer number of contracts, under time constraints, looking for potential criticalities. A process that is tiring, tedious and error-prone.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Second, the risk of availability bias.</strong> It’s a well-established practice, in due diligence, to examine only a sample of all the contracts available – typically only 10% or 20% of the total contract pool. Not rarely, critical pieces of information are missed in this phase, and only after the M&amp;A process is concluded, do potentially unfavourable clauses come to light.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can AI help mitigate risks?</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An AI-powered software like<a href=\"/\"> Cognitiv+</a> helps cut the time they spend on repetitive activities and substantially reduce the risk associated with any M&amp;A due diligence process.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Review contracts</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/cognitiv-features-in-a-nutshell-contract-review/\">Cognitiv+</a> can review thousands of contracts in one fraction of the time.

Force-majeure, change of control, indemnity – all the clauses that associates have to go through when dealing with the deadly process of due diligence, can be extracted for an easy review, saving an incredible amount of time. Cognitiv+ automatically exports all outlined clauses in a word or excel documents, detailing the level of severity of each clause.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Compare contracts</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contract review, it’s important to compare your documents to other approved contracts, to see what changes have been made and <strong>underline potentially unfavourable differences.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a data-sveltekit-reload href=\"/blog/cognitiv-features-in-a-nutshell-contract-comparison/\">Cognitiv+</a> can do this automatically. The AI-enabled software can compare your new contracts against your previous, approved contracts, point out the differences and highlight them with an intuitive, traffic light system.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reviewing contracts is not only extremely tedious – so much for job satisfaction – it also carries a high potential of error, in turn, increases the stress. Our comparison tool reduces the risk of mistakes, and gives you the peace of mind of an added pair of eyes.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI tools like Cognitiv+ can reduce the amount of time spent on tedious reviewing process, reduce error rates and leave associates and senior lawyers more time to focus on more rewarding activities.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"/contact\">Schedule a Demo</a></h3>",

        "post_body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dreaded time is approaching. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;The LIBOR benchmark interest rate is set to expire in 2021. This poses tremendous challenges for contract managers as LIBOR is embedded into almost all financial contracts with a variable interest rate component.</span></p> \n<!--more-->\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that <strong>all contracts containing references to LIBOR will need to be reviewed and amended</strong> (a process called <strong>repapering</strong>) – while evaluating the consequences that LIBOR’s discontinuation and the transition to alternatives may cause. It is an enormous and costly endeavor for all financial institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"/\"><strong>Cognitiv+</strong></a><strong> deep learning technology can improve the repapering process</strong>, guaranteeing accuracy, facilitating interpretation of contract clauses, and mitigating financial and legal risks.&nbsp; Cognitiv+ manages risk in 5 dimensions ensuring full visibility and guaranteeing that nothing is missed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Extreme Accuracy</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitiv+ utilizes a filtering process for all contracts to ensure that relevant documents are identified, analyzed and presented without time-consuming legal processing. It also flags contracts that do not require processing because they would terminate by the end of the 2021 deadline.</span></p> \n<h3>Handles Many Formats</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LIBOR has been incorporated into many types of contracts and documents, which may have been stored in different formats: PDFs, Word Docs, even jpgs or pngs.&nbsp; With Cognitiv+ technology, every document is broken down into sections and converted into HTML to enable processing and annotation. This helps ensure that the final version of the new re-papered contract is clean and readable.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Intelligent LIBOR identification</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All mentions of&nbsp;LIBOR&nbsp;are extracted with the help of a natural language processing model. If the agreement actually has a back-up for the discontinuation of&nbsp;LIBOR, but it is not explicitly mentioned, Cognitiv+ is able to identify the particular section(s) that refer to LIBOR.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Make Amendments at Scale</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After identifying all instances of LIBOR in the documents, Cognitiv+ will identify each clause in order to add alternative reference rates like SOFR or SONIA.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Complex Interpretations</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognitiv+&nbsp; automatically extracts a list of provisions that indicate what would happen in the event of a LIBOR rate discontinuation. Together with the automatic definition extraction, Cognitiv+ helps </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">financial institutions interpret the context and assess the consequences of LIBOR discontinuation within the general framework of the agreement.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Traceability<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing a clear Audit Trail, Cognitiv+ saves and visualises all version changes and amendments with a time-saving traffic-light system that also displays redlines. It also enables all authorized parties involved to collaborate on a project.&nbsp;</span></p> \n<h3>Customization and Integration</h3> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clients can amend, add or develop their own models to apply to their own documents.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We offer an API that will seamlessly integrate with your </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DMS or ERP</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to find and process your documents, send them back, and recycle them if a new version is provided to review.</span></p> \n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know too well, from experience, that in the process,&nbsp; repapering can easily spiral out of control.</span></p> \n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><a style=\"color: #ff6600;\" href=\"/contact\">Request a free Cognitiv+ Demo&nbsp;</a></span></h3>",

Instead, they dedicate a large chunk of their time to rummaging through documents, looking for key provisions and potentially risky clauses — then summarizing them into a Word or Excel file.</p> \n<!--more-->\n<p>If this doesn’t sound particularly exciting, well, it’s probably because it isn’t. In truth, this busywork is a tedious, time-consuming job that no one wants to do, and that’s why it’s frequently dropped on the desk of junior lawyers.</p> \n<p>Machine learning technologies (like <strong><a href=\"/\">Cognitiv+</a></strong>) can help dramatically speed up the contract review process — cutting time, costs, and last but not least, the risks coupled with a manual process.</p> \n<h3></h3> \n<h3><img class=\"hs-image-align-none\" src=\"https://resources.cognitivplus.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/missing-image-May-17-2022-04-30-21-35-PM.png\" data-mce-placeholder=\"\">The Advantages of Automated Contract Review</h3> \n<p>Automated contract reviews offer two main advantages. They allow for a faster, more-attentive review of the document and summarise the results in an easily digestible format. Documents can be uploaded into <strong>Cognitiv+</strong> in DOC, DOCX, and PDF and are automatically converted into a machine-readable format.</p> \n<p><strong>Cognitiv+</strong> is trained to read contracts and recognise major data insights: key clauses such as parties, definitions, terms and terminations, liabilities, etc. After reading, the software automatically extracts key points, providing a clear summary. This summary is a breeze to scroll through and can be exported in Word format or in a structured Excel table that allows the user to refine results and make them searchable.</p> \n<p><strong>Cognitiv+</strong> is ready for use right off the shelf: it doesn’t require training to recognise key clauses in a contract. However, it can be personalised: the user can select to manually annotate the document, so the software can automatically read contracts for user-specified provisions (e.g. change of control, assignment, or other clauses).</p> \n<p><strong>Cognitiv+</strong>’s highly accurate machine learning technology can identify and analyze relevant contract provisions, resulting in customer-reported time savings of 30–70%.</p>",

Among the new regulations this year are the revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2), which requires banks to make customer data available to third parties, with the customer’s consent; the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), which went into effect last week – all before structural banking reforms, with ringfencing, are implemented in January 2019.</p> \n<p>The 20 companies on this year’s shortlist of innovative startups come from the U.K., Israel, Croatia and South Korea, offering technology solutions for many pressing business issues, including:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>aiding and automating compliance processes, using analytics and robotics;</li> \n <li>detecting financial crime and fraud, using artificial intelligence;</li> \n <li>helping insurers predict and price cyber risk;</li> \n <li>ensuring the security of payments and digital identity through blockchain solutions; and</li> \n <li>developing financial management platforms across connected devices.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>“The risk of non-compliance is what keeps financial boards awake at night,” said Julian Skan, executive sponsor of Accenture Fintech Innovation Lab London. “As the drive for better customer experience and lower unit costs pushes data into the cloud, the price of getting things wrong has risen. It’s a pivotal moment for technology solutions to help banks and insurers not just to meet the needs of regulators, but make the most of the digital economy.</p> \n<p>“Above all, financial firms know they need to improve their productivity, particularly in the UK economy, and innovations can be the lightbulb moment for banks and insurers to operate more effectively and deliver better results. This year’s cohorts have shown how start-ups are learning to focus on problems that can be solved and to understand what they need to learn from incumbents who are facing the challenges of meeting digital customer expectations with legacy infrastructure.”</p> \n<p>More than 270 start-ups from 42 countries applied to this year’s program, with the shortlisted start-ups being mentored by the program’s biggest-ever cohort of financial services executives.</p> \n<p>Partners come from over 32 financial institutions including: AIB, AXA, BAML, Citi, Credit Suisse, Direct Line, DNB, Ergo, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Intesa Sanpaolo, JPMC, Legal and General, Lloyds Banking Group, LV=, Morgan Stanley, MS Amlin, Nationwide, Nordea, OP, Post Office Management Service, RBS, RSA, Santander, Societe Generale, Towergate, TSB, UBI, UBS, XL Catlin, Zurich.</p> \n<p>Dan Zinkin, a managing director at JP Morgan Chase, said, “Financial firms have an important role in collaborating with start-ups to develop new technologies that can transform our industry. We must keep ahead of a rapidly changing world and keep striving to innovate for our customers and improving our services. I am thrilled to be a part of a program dedicated to bringing financial firms and entrepreneurs together to navigate the future of the industry.”</p> \n<p>Learn more at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fintechinnovationlab.com/london\">fintechinnovationlab.com/london</a></p> \n<p><strong>About FinTech Innovation Lab London</strong><br> The FinTech Innovation Lab London is a mentorship programme for entrepreneurs in the financial services sector – particularly in the areas of big data; analytics and cognitive computing; security and identity management; risk management and compliance; digital marketing and social media; cloud; payments; blockchain technology; talent management; and Internet of Things applications.</p>",

While auditors spend considerable time flipping pages and opening individual digital files to review them, it is arguable that artificial intelligence could help on some of those tasks.</p> \n   <p>AI is definitely not the right vehicle for very complex analysis, but for those repetitive, semi-defined tasks, a well-tuned system will start counting items, spot patterns, and flag anomalies to a level that meets and exceeds the requirements of a corporate exercise.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<!--more-->\n<div class=\"x-container max width\"> \n <div class=\"x-column x-sm x-1-2\"> \n  <div class=\"x-text cs-ta-justify\"> \n   <p>Cognitive systems can emulate structured processes and pre-defined tasks that normally are undertaken manually, collect information from thousands of documents and structure them in a way that brings anomalies faster to light. Further audits have historically involved taking samples of populations. With the power of big data and analytics, the auditor can choose to analyse all items in certain populations, not just a sample of them.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div class=\"x-column x-sm x-1-2\"> \n  <blockquote class=\"x-blockquote center-text\"> \n   <p>“With big data and analytics, auditors can choose to analyse all items, instead of just a sample”</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"x-container max width\"> \n <div class=\"x-column x-sm x-1-1\"> \n  <div class=\"x-text\"> \n   <p>AI can read thousands of contracts and extract what the auditors are after without the need to read them. Systems can also analyse entire sets of expenses, read the entire text, categorise the expenses and potentially expose non-authorised claims.</p> \n   <p>Systems can identify indications of fraud, just by reviewing changes in patterns of invoices over time or unusual invoiced items, and quantities based on previous history. Auditors have some leads to identify mismanagement and save millions to their companies.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"x-container max width\"> \n <div class=\"x-column x-sm x-1-2\"> \n  <blockquote class=\"x-blockquote center-text\"> \n   <p>“AI introduces the idea of continuous auditing and proactive analysis”</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <div class=\"x-column x-sm x-1-2\"> \n  <div class=\"x-text\"> \n   <p>In addition, AI introduces the idea of continuous auditing and proactive analysis. Investigations can be programmed on a regular basis and auditors will have the opportunity to focus to more advanced analysis. AI can apply risk indicators to large datasets to detect risks that would otherwise remain hidden.</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"x-container max width\"> \n <div class=\"x-column x-sm x-1-1\"> \n  <div class=\"x-text\"> \n   <p>For the audit professionals, this can be translated both as an opportunity or a threat.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.accaglobal.com/us/en/technical-activities/technical-resources-search/2013/october/digital-darwinism.html\">Association of Chartered Certified Accountants</a>&nbsp;has predicted that over the next two years automation will simplify processes such as bookkeeping and transaction coding, enabling accountants to focus on advisory services and other higher-value work.</p> \n   <p>To achieve this, auditors need to enhance skills such us data management and machine learning, something that universities do not currently provide. It is those professionals that understand auditing methodologies along with technologies that will show us the road to automation.</p> \n   <p>It is an exciting path!</p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"x-container max width\"> \n <div class=\"x-column x-sm cs-ta-center x-1-1\"> \n  <hr> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div class=\"x-container max width\"> \n <div class=\"x-column x-sm x-1-1\"> \n  <div class=\"x-text\"> \n   <p><em>This article has been first published in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk/audit-artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital Catapult Blog</a>.</em></p> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div>",
